We refer to this concept as the dispersion \u2013 dissolution \u2013 dose (DDD) relationship. We review the various techniques which are appropriate to determine each component of the DDD relationship in turn and show that either expert use of a single technique or combined use of a number of techniques including electron microscopy is required to quantify their interrelationship. In the long term quantification and importantly modelling of this DDD relationship will enable mechanistic understanding of exposure pathways and prediction of both toxicity and NM-based drug delivery.\n               \n            ",

The main reason for this strong interest is that it is now possible to develop NMs with new or strongly modified properties compared to their bulk counterparts. However the new properties occurring when size decrease is most of the time directly related to the increase of the ratio between surface atoms versus atoms in the core of the particles. Therefore most of NMs' properties can be considered as a consequence of their specific surface properties. The chapter will first remind the main surface properties (surface charge, adsorption, photocatalytic reactions, atomic surface structure, etc.) and it will describe how they can be modified when size decrease. In a second part, the chapter will introduce different techniques that can provide specific information of surface atoms and their reactivity. A large variety of surface-specific, spectroscopic and microscopic techniques will be detailed.\n               \n            ",

To this end, a nanoalloy must present a sizable magnetic moment and a strong magnetic anisotropy. In principle, these properties can be achieved by combining 3d with 4d or 5d transition metals. Here the basic features of magnetism in nanoparticles are summarized, together with the main experimental techniques that are presently used to characterize nanoalloy magnetism.
