  "abstract": "A two-step synthesis was used to control the shape of silver nanoparticles. First, a few spherical silver nanoparticles, \u223c10 nm in size, were\nprepared via reduction of Ag+ ions in aqueous Ag(NH3)2NO3 by poly(N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone) (PVP). Then, in a subsequent hydrothermal treatment,\nthe remaining Ag+ ions were reduced by PVP into polyhedral nanoparticles, or larger spherical nanoparticles formed from the small spherical seed\nsilver nanoparticles in the first step. The morphology and size of the resultant particles depend on the hydrothermal temperature, PVP/Ag molar\nratio and concentration of Ag+ ions. By using UV\u2013visible spectroscopy (UV\u2013vis), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and powder X-ray\ndiffraction (XRD), the possible growth mechanism of the silver nanoparticles was discussed.",

Comparison of\ntheoretical (Mie light scattering theory) and experimental results\nshowed that diameter of silver nanoparticles in colloidal solution is\nabout 60 nm. We have used energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDX),\nX-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM)\nand, UV\u2013Vis spectroscopy to characterize the nanoparticles obtained.\nThe energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDX) of the nanoparticles\ndispersion confirmed the presence of elemental silver signal no peaks\nof other impurity were detected. The average size and morphology of\nsilver nanoparticles were determined by transmission electron\nmicroscopy (TEM). TEM photographs indicate that the nanopowders\nconsist of well dispersed agglomerates of grains with a narrow size\ndistribution (40 and 60 nm), whereas the radius of the individual\nparticles are between 10 and 20 nm. The synthesized nanoparticles\nhave been structurally characterized by X-ray diffraction and\ntransmission high-energy electron diffraction (HEED). The peaks in\nthe XRD pattern are in good agreement with the standard values of\nthe face-centered-cubic form of metallic silver (ICCD-JCPDS card\nno. 4-0787) and no peaks of other impurity crystalline phases were\ndetected. Additionally, the antibacterial activity of the nanopart\u00edculas\ndispersion was measured by Kirby-Bauer method.

Then, 30 mL acetone was added and the resulting solution was mixed under magnetic agitation during 20 min. To this solution, 1.5 g PVP powder was added and the agitation was continued for another 35 min. After 30 min agitation, the PVP was observed to agglomerate and to stick onto the bottom and thewalls of the beaker. At the end of the mixing period the remaining acetonewas decanted. The solid PVP, initially white, turned into a light brown and then dark brown paste at the end of this treatment with the aqueous solution of silver nitrate and acetone, indicating the formation of silver nanoparticles embedded in the polymer matrix. A small amount of this material was deposited onto a microscope glass slide and pressed with another slide to produce a suf\ufb01ciently thin and transparent \ufb01lm for UV\u2013vis characterization. The \ufb01nal solid recovered was allowed to dry in air for 48 h and then characterized by IR spectroscopy using the KBr pellet technique. Colloidal dispersions of PVP-protected silver in ethylene glycol were prepared by dissolving the dry, pre-treated PVP\u2013Ag colloid powder in 50 mL ethylene glycol under magnetic agitation and keeping the stirring for up to 18 days."

  "abstract": "A systematic and detailed study for size-specific antibacterial efficacy of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs)\nsynthesized using a co-reduction approach is presented here. Nucleation and growth kinetics during the\nsynthesis process was precisely controlled and AgNPs of average size 5, 7, 10, 15, 20, 30, 50, 63, 85, and\n100 nm were synthesized with good yield and monodispersity. We found the bacteriostatic/bactericidal\neffect of AgNPs to be size and dose-dependent as determined by the minimum inhibitory concentration\n(MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of silver nanoparticles against four bacterial strains.\nOut of the tested strains, Escherichia coli MTCC 443 and Staphylococcus aureus NCIM 5201 were found\nto be the most and least sensitive strains regardless of AgNP size. For AgNPs with less than 10 nm size,\nthe antibacterial efficacy was significantly enhanced as revealed through delayed bacterial growth\nkinetics, corresponding MIC/MBC values and disk diffusion tests. AgNPs of the smallest size, i.e., 5 nm\ndemonstrated the best results and mediated the fastest bactericidal activity against all the tested strains\ncompared to AgNPs having 7 nm and 10 nm sizes at similar bacterial concentrations. TEM analysis of\nAgNP treated bacterial cells showed the presence of AgNPs on the cell membrane, and AgNPs\ninternalized within the cells.",

  "experimental": "Silver nanoparticles were synthesized employing sodium borohydride\n(NaBH4) as a primary reductant and, trisodium citrate\n(TSC), both as secondary reductant as well as stabilizing agent.\nThe reduction processes were carried out at two different\ntemperatures, i.e. at 60  C and 90  C, mediated predominantly\nby, sodium borohydride and trisodium citrate, respectively. A\ntypical procedure is as follows: the required volumes of freshly\nprepared aqueous solutions containing NaBH4 and TSC were\nmixed and heated to 60  C for 30 minutes in the dark with\nvigorous stirring to ensure a homogenous solution. At the end\nof 30 minutes, the required volume of AgNO3 solution was\nadded drop-wise to the mixture and subsequently, the temperature\nwas further raised to 90  C. As the temperature reached\n90  C, the pH of the solution was adjusted to 10.5 using 0.1 M\nNaOH while heating was continued for 20 minutes, until a\nchange of colour was evident. The nanoparticle suspension was\nallowed to cool at room temperature. In order to remove the\nunreacted reductants, AgNP suspensions were centrifuged\n(12 000 rpm, 15 minutes) and washed thrice, followed by\nredispersion in DI water and were \ue103nally stored at 4  C for\nfuture use. For determining the yield of AgNPs, the silver\nnanoparticles formed (collected by centrifugation at 14 000\nrpm, 20 minutes) were dissolved in dilute HNO3 and the total\nmass of silver in the form of AgNPs was determined by inductively\ncoupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ARCOS\nICP-AES spectro, Germany). Subsequently, yield was determined\nas a ratio of mass of silver in the form of nanoparticles to the\nmass of silver (Ag+) added to the \ue104ask during the synthesis\nreaction. Table 1 shows the optimized reaction conditions and\ndetails pertaining to the synthesis of different sized AgNPs."

A 10-mL volume of 1.0 mM silver nitrate was added dropwise (about 1 drop/second) to 30 mL of 2.0 mM sodium borohydride solution that had been chilled in an ice-bath. The reaction mixture was stirred vigorously on a magnetic stir plate. The solution turned light yellow after the addition of 2 mL of silver nitrate and a brighter yellow (Figure 1A) when all of the silver nitrate had been added. The entire addition took about three minutes, after which the stirring was stopped and the stir bar removed. The clear yellow colloidal silver shown on the left in the photograph in Figure 1, is stable at room temperature stored in a transparent vial for as long as several weeks or months."

  "abstract": "Mercaptoacetic acid-capped spherical silver nanoparticles with a diameter of about 17nmwere prepared\nby a simple chemical reaction. The formation process of the silver nanoparticles was investigated by\nUV-visible(UV-vis) spectroscopyandtransmission electron microscopy.Theresultsshowthat the spherical\nand rodlike particles were formed at the beginning of the reaction, and then the rodlike particles were\ngradually converted into spherical particles with the reaction continuing. Finally, the content of the rodlike\nparticles was less than 3% in the silver colloid. Thus, the final obtained silver nanoparticles were uniform\nin their shapes and showed little variation in their sizes. This silver colloid can remain stable for several\nweeks, which makes it convenient for use in practice. We also investigated the effect of Cl- on the rate\nof changes in the optical properties of the silver colloid by UV-vis absorption. The results indicate that\nCl- accelerates the aggregation of the colloidal particles by effectively screening the repulsive electrostatic\ninteractions between the negatively charged silver particles. We used the self-assembled technique to\ntransfer the silver nanoparticles onto solid substrates from the colloid with and without Cl- in the solution.\nTheUV-vis spectra show that the absorption band red shifts and anewband appears at a longer wavelength\nwhen the silver nanoparticles are transferred onto the substrate from the colloid with Cl- in the solution,\nindicating that the silver nanoparticles can grow and aggregate on the substrate. This was further confirmed\nby the atomic force microscopy measurements. Both the silver colloid and the substrates prepared by\ntransferring the silver nanoparticles from the silver colloidal solution onto the quartz slides can serve as\nsurface-enhancedRamanspectroscopy (SERS)-active substrates. It was found that theSERSenhancement\ndepends on the sizes and aggregation of the silver particles, and the addition of Cl- generates much\nstronger SERS signals.",

Two-dimensional ordered superlattices of the nanoparticles were formed on\ncarbon films coated on transmission electron microscopy (TEM) copper grids by evaporating a drop of the\ndispersion in chloroform. The formation process of the silver nanoparticles was investigated byUV-visible\nabsorption spectroscopy and TEM. A blue shift of the maximum absorption peak position of the UV-vis\nspectra occurred at the beginning of the reaction, followed by a red shift. This result indicated that large\nthiol-capped silver nanoparticles were formed at the beginning, then the large particles were decomposed\ninto small particles, and in the final stage the small particles enlarged slightly again. The TEM images\nshow directly the same process with the results from the UV-vis spectra. In addition, the UV-visible\nspectra of the silver nanoparticle colloidal phase obtained finally show that the system is monodisperse\nand can remain stable for several weeks.",

  "abstract": "Silver nanostructures have been synthesized via a microwave-assisted polyol method by adding sodium sulfide (Na2S) into the solution. An interesting morphology evolution can be observed by adjusting the concentration of Na2S and the heating power. It is found that the ideal concentration of Na2S is 31.25\u2013500  \u00b5M for the fast reduction of Ag+ at 300 W under optimal conditions for producing monodispersed silver nanocubes. When the heating power is increased to 400 W, 62.5\u2013250  \u00b5M is the ideal concentration of Na2S for the synthesis of silver nanocubes. On increasing the concentration of Na2S (>500 \u00b5M), a mixture of silver nanowires, nanocubes, bipyramids, and irregular/quasispherical particles is synthesized at 300 and 400 W. In particular, an increase in the concentration of Na2S to 750 \u00b5M at 400 W leads to the production of a quantity of silver nanowires. In addition, silver nanocubes with controllable sizes can be obtained by changing the concentration of Na2S and the heating power. Compared to traditional wet-chemical methods, this method has the advantage of a marked decrease in reaction time to 3.5 min. Finally, our work provides a simple strategy for fabricating silver nanostructures with controllable morphologies and sizes.",

Afterward, the solutions were transferred to a microwave oven operating at 2.45 GHz and heated. To prevent EG from vaporizing, we stopped the reaction after each heating step. Upon completion of the reaction, the solutions were allowed to cool down in air. Silver nanocubes and nanowires were easily separated from EG by the addition of a large amount of acetone, followed by sonication and centrifugation.

With a fixed CTAB concentration, truncated silver nanocubes with sizes of 49.3 \u00b1 4.1 nm were produced when the molar ratio of glucose/silver cation was maintained at 0.1. The sample exhibited (1 0 0), (1 1 0), and (1 1 1) planes on the facets, edges, and corners, respectively. In contrast, with a slightly larger glucose/silver cation ratio of 0.35, well-defined nanocubes with sizes of 70.9 \u00b1 3.8 nm sizes were observed with the (1 0 0) plane on six facets. When the ratio was further increased to 1.5, excess reduction of silver cations facilitated the simultaneous formation of nanoparticles with cubic, spherical, and irregular shapes.

  "experimental": "The truncated silver nanocubes were fabricated via a hydrothermal synthetic route using silver nitrate, ammonia, glucose, and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as precursors. First, 0.17 g of silver nitrate was dissolved in 20 ml of deionized water, followed by the stepwise addition of 1 M ammonia aqueous solution. After the ammonia was added, the transparent silver nitrate solution turned brown briefly, and as the amount of ammonia was increased, the mixture appeared transparent again. At this stage, the silver cations were present as [Ag(NH3)2]+. Subsequently, we added extra deionized water to render a 10 mM [Ag(NH3)2]+ solution. To form the desired silver nanoparticles, 25 ml of 10 mM [Ag(NH3)2]+ solution was properly mixed with 15 ml of 50 mM CTAB aqueous solution and 50 ml of glucose aqueous solution. The glucose solution functioned as a reducing agent, and the sample prepared with various concentrations of glucose (i.e., 0.5, 1.75, and 7.5 mM), were designated as SA, SB, and SC, respectively. The CTAB was used as a surfactant for its anisotropic adsorption behavior on distinct crystallographic planes, which allows the silver nuclei to evolve into distinct shapes. The mixture was heated in an autoclave at 120 \u00b0C for 8 h and was allowed to cool to 25 \u00b0C afterwards. The sample was subsequently centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 20 min to retrieve the silver nanoparticles for characterization and electrochemical analysis."

  "abstract": "Silver nanocubes (NCs) with different edge lengths were successfully prepared by a facile hydrothermal method with glucose as a reducing agent. The average edge length of the silver NCs could be tailored from 45 to 75 nm by changing the amount of glucose and the reaction time. Even larger silver NCs with average edge length of 105 nm could be synthesized by a secondary hydrothermal growth process. The experiment results of the size-dependent surface plasmon resonance properties of these silver NCs were directly compared with theoretical calculations. The surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) efficiency of these silver NCs was further evaluated by using rhodamine 6G and 4-mercaptobenzoic acid as Raman probe molecules. It was demonstrated that the intensity of SERS signal was related to the sizes of the samples, and the highest signal was observed by selecting the 105 nm silver NCs as substrates. Moreover, the silver NCs showed significant advantage on improving the homogeneity of the SERS intensity.",

Then, 5 mL [Ag(NH3)2]OH, 5 mL CTAB (50 mM), and 10 mL glucose (1.5 or 1 mM) aqueous solution was sequentially mixed and transferred to a 25 mL autoclave, sealed and maintained at 120 \u00b0C for 8 h. After the autoclave was cooled to room temperature naturally, the resulting 45 or 65 nm silver NCs were separated by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 20 min and washed with deionized water for characterization. The 75 nm silver NCs were prepared by lengthening the hydrothermal time for the precursor solution with 1 mM glucose to 12 h. In order to obtain further larger silver NCs, a secondary growth method was applied. In a standard synthesis, 5 mL the as-prepared 65 nm silver NCs, 5 mL [Ag(NH3)2]OH, 5 mL CTAB (50 mM), and 10 mL glucose (1 mM) in aqueous solutions were mixed together as the precursor solution. Then the mixture solution was transferred to a 30 mL autoclave, sealed and maintained at 120 \u00b0C for 8 h. The 105 nm silver NCs were finally obtained. The preparation process for these silver NCs is proposed as shown in Scheme 1. R6G or 4MBA-labeled silver NCs were prepared as follow: 20 \u03bcL of R6G or 4MBA (1 mM) ethanol solution was added to 5 mL of the purified silver NCs solution under stirring and agitated for 12 h at room temperature. Then, the unbound Raman report molecules were removed by centrifugation, and silver NCs modified with R6G or 4MBA were obtained. Then, an aliquot of the dispersed solution (20 \u03bcL) was dropped onto a glass slide under ambient conditions. After evaporation of the solvent, SERS spectra of the samples were measured."

When a low-concentration NaCl solution is used, trace amounts of silver chloride (AgCl)\nappear and act as the seeds to facilitate the formation of the silver nanowires. However, when a high-concentration NaCl solution is\nused, large amounts of AgCl appear and mainly act as the controlling agent leading to the formation of silver nanocubes and bipyramids.\nElectron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and absorption spectra have been used to investigate the products, and a mechanism is proposed\nto interpret the morphological control of these structures.

  "abstract": "This article describes a robust method for the facile\nsynthesis of small Ag nanocubes with edge lengths controlled in the\nrange of 18\n\u2212\n32 nm. The success of this new method relies on the\nsubstitution of ethylene glycol (EG)\n\ue0d5\nthe solvent most commonly used\nin a polyol synthesis\n\ue0d5\nwith diethylene glycol (DEG). Owing to the\nincrease in hydrocarbon chain length, DEG possesses a higher viscosity\nand a lower reducing power relative to EG. As a result, we were able to\nachieve a nucleation burst in the early stage to generate a large number\nof seeds and a relatively slow growth rate thereafter; both factors were\ncritical to the formation of Ag nanocubes with small sizes and in high\npurity (>95%). The edge length of the Ag nanocubes could be easily\ntailored in the range of 18\n\u2212\n32 nm by quenching the reaction at\ndi\nff\nerent time points. For the\nfi\nrst time, we were able to produce uniform sub-20 nm Ag nanocubes in a hydrophilic medium and\non a scale of\n\u223c\n20 mg per batch. It is also worth pointing out that the present protocol was remarkably robust, showing good\nreproducibility between di\nff\nerent batches and even for DEGs obtained from di\nff\nerent vendors. Our results suggest that the high\nsensitivity of synthesis outcomes to the trace amounts of impurities in a polyol, a major issue for reproducibility and scale up\nsynthesis, did not exist in the present system.",

By adding a trace amount of sodium sulfide (Na2S) or sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) to the conventional polyol synthesis, the reaction time was significantly shortened from 16\u201326 hours to 3\u20138 minutes. By merely adjusting the reaction time, monodispersed silver nanocubes of 25-45 nm in edge length were rapidly and routinely produced on relatively large scales. These small nanocubes are of great interest for biomedical applications by way of generating gold nanocages with plasmon resonance peaks tunable to the near-infrared region through a galvanic replacement reaction.",

A 3 mM solution of Na2S (Aldrich, 208043) or NaHS (Aldrich, 161527) in EG was also prepared 45 minutes prior to injection. Shortly after injecting 80 \u03bcL of the sulfide solution, 1.5 mL and 0.5 mL of the PVP and AgNO3 solutions were sequentially injected (all with a micro-pipettor). As silver nitrate was added, the clear and colorless solution immediately turned purple-black, followed instantly by a transparent bright yellow color. The appearance of yellow color indicates the formation of small silver particles. After 2\u20133 minutes into the reaction, the solution darkened to an orange-yellow color and some silver nanoparticles were observed to deposit on the wall of the vial. After 6\u20138 minutes, the solution changed to an opalescent ruddy-brown and concurrently became opaque. If allowed to continue, the solution faded to a lighter, whitish-brown color but remained opaque. The final produce was diluted with acetone and collected by centrifugation, washed with water, and then suspended in water (4 mL) for future use. Since Na2S and NaHS gave similar results, we will focus on Na2S in the following discussion."

  "abstract": "It remains a challenge to synthesize Ag\nnanocubes in an aqueous system, although the polyol\nprocess was successfully adopted more than one decade ago.\nHere, we report an aqueous method for the synthesis of Ag\nnanocubes with an average edge length of 35\n\u2212\n95 nm. It\ninvolves the formation of AgCl octahedra by mixing\nCF\n3\nCOOAg with cetyltrimethylammonium chloride, fol-\nlowed by the nucleation and growth of Ag nanocrystals in\nthe presence of ascorbic acid (AA) and FeCl\n3\n. The Fe\n3+\n/Fe\n2+\nredox pair is responsible for the removal of multiply twinned\nseeds through oxidative etching. The Cl\n\u2212\nions play two critical roles in the nucleation and growth of Ag nanocubes with a\nsingle-crystal structure. First, the Cl\n\u2212\nions react with Ag\n+\nions to generate nanometer-sized AgCl octahedra in the initial\nstage of a synthesis. In the presence of room light and a proper reducing agent such as AA, the AgCl can be reduced to\ngenerate Ag\nn\nnuclei followed by their evolution into single-crystal seeds and then Ag nanocrystals. Second, the Cl\n\u2212\nions can\nact as a speci\nfi\nc capping agent toward the Ag(100) surface, enabling the formation of Ag nanocubes with sharp corners and\nedges. Based on the results from a set of time-lapse studies and control experiments, we formulate a plausible mechanism to\naccount for the formation of Ag nanocubes that resembles the formation and development of latent image centers in silver\nhalide grains in the photographic process.",

The vial was then capped and heated at 140\u2009\u00b0C. Upon injection of the solution of AgNO3, the reaction mixture went through a series of color changes that included milky white, light yellow, transparent, red, and ocher. To separate the roles of the proton and chloride, we performed a synthesis under the same conditions except for the replacement of HCl by HNO3. For the scale-up synthesis, the vial was replaced with a 100-mL flask, and the volumes of all solutions were increased by a factor of five."

  "abstract": "Conventional polyol synthesis has been widely used for the preparation of silver nanostructures with different morphologies. However, there is a drawback that it is difficult to control the reaction parameters for shape-controlled synthesis of silver nanostructures, such as the rate of the addition of silver ions to the solution. In this paper, we combine polyol process and solvothermal method for easily synthesizing silver nanostructures. Importantly, the introduction of cuprous chloride (CuCl) to the reaction leads to increasing the population of twinned Ag seeds (required for wire growth) at the expense of that of single Ag seeds. Silver nanowires (Ag NWs) with uniform width (~80 nm in width) can be obtained in the presence of poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP). Some other parameters, such as the reaction temperature and molar ratios of the repeating unit of PVP to AgNO3 (R), also have been discussed. A possible mechanism is put forward to understand the evolution of silver nanostructures.",

Briefly, 0.087 g PVP was dissolved in 10 mL EG solution of CuCl (20 \u03bcM), and then 10 mL EG solution of AgNO3 (0.05 M) was quickly added into the above solution. The mixed solution was stirred for about 1 min and put into a 25 mL Teflon-lined autoclave. This autoclave was then sealed and heated at 160 \u00b0C for 2.5 h. Afterwards, the solution was cooled to room temperature. Acetone was added to the solution and the mixture was centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 10 min. The precipitate was washed with water four times to remove PVP residue. The as-prepared Ag NWs were dispersed into deionized water for further characterization."

  "abstract": "Silver nanowires (Ag NWs) are the promising materials to fabricate flexible transparent electrodes, aiming to replace indium tin oxide (ITO) in the next generation of flexible electronics. Herein, a feasible polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-mediated polyol synthesis of Ag NWs with different aspect ratios is demonstrated and high-quality Ag NWs transparent electrodes (NTEs) are fabricated without high-temperature thermal sintering. When employing the mixture of PVP with different average molecular weight as the capping agent, the diameters of Ag NWs can be tailored and Ag NWs with different aspect ratios varying from ca. 30 to ca. 1000 are obtained. Using these as-synthesized Ag NWs, the uniform Ag NWs films are fabricated by repeated spin coating. When the aspect ratios exceed 500, the optoelectronic performance of Ag NWs films improve remarkably and match up to those of ITO films. Moreover, an optimal Ag NTEs with low sheet resistance of 11.4 \u03a9/sq and a high parallel transmittance of 91.6% at 550 nm are achieved when the aspect ratios reach almost 1000. In addition, the sheet resistance of Ag NWs films does not show great variation after 400 cycles of bending test, suggesting an excellent flexibility. The proposed approach to fabricate highly flexible and high-performance Ag NTEs would be useful to the development of flexible devices.",

Then, 0.15 M of PVP-40 and 0.111 mM of CuCl2\u00b72H2O mixed solution in 10 mL of EG is added dropwise to the above solution. Afterwards, the mixture is transferred into Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave with a capacity of 50 mL and heated at 160 \u00b0C for 3 h. After cooling down to room temperature naturally, pure Ag NWs are obtained by centrifugation at a speed of 2500 rpm for 5 min and washed three times with ethanol and deionized water. Finally, the products are dispersed in ethanol for further characterization and application. Moreover, the concentration and average molecular weight of PVP are very important to control the morphology and size of products. Therefore, different types of PVP molecules are simultaneously used to regulate the diameters of Ag NWs in the polyol process. Detailed experimental parameters are listed in Additional file 1: Table S1, nominated as S1\u2013S13, respectively."

These nanowires could be synthesized by a facile but effective polyol\u2212thermal reaction method in autoclaves (160\u2212180 \u00b0C). The nearly uniform-size silver nanowires show an average diameter of \u223c45 nm and length up to tens of micrometers. The microstructure and optical properties of the silver nanowires were characterized by various advanced techniques, including TEM, HRTEM, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and ultraviolet\u2212visible (UV\u2212vis) spectroscopy. The twinned structure can occur in both silver spherical particles and nanowires, confirmed by HRTEM analysis and also simulated by molecular dynamics methods. The growth of V-shaped nanowires by two possible means was particularly investigated: (i) crystal lattice match-induced end-to-end or end-to-side fusion of two nanowires, and (ii) twinned crystal plane-induced growth. Such structural and mechanistic understanding of silver crystals would be useful for the shape, size, and property control of functional nanoparticles.",

When the first drops of silver nitrate and PVP EG solutions were added, the mixture turned yellow immediately. With the injecting continuing, the solution became opaque gradually. After injection, the solution turned turbid with a grey color in about 15 min, indicating the appearance of Ag nanowires, and the reaction continued at 160 \u00b0C for 60 min. When the reaction finished, the supernatant was removed; the grey precipitate remained and needed no further purification. The samples for SEM measurement were prepared on n-Si(1 0 0) wafer. The SEM images were obtained using Hitachi S-5200. TEM and SAED investigations were performed with Tecnai 20 at 200 kV."

Then glucose (0.04 g, 0.2 mmol) was dissolved in the above colloidal solution; this was then transferred into a stainless steel autoclave with a Teflon liner of 50 mL capacity, and heated in an oven at 180\u2009\u00b0C for 18 h. After the autoclave was air-cooled to room temperature unaided, the resulting silver-gray fluffy precipitate was filtered and washed with distilled water and absolute ethanol, then dried under vacuum at 60\u2009\u00b0C for 2 h."

  "abstract": "Silver nanowires and silver-nanowire thin films have attracted much attention due to their extensive applications in Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) and Surface-Enhanced Fluorescence (SEF). Thin films of silver nanowires within polyelectrolyte layers of poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) and poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS) were fabricated by the Spin-Assisted Layer-by-Layer (SA-LbL) method. The surface coverage, thickness, and absorbance properties of the silver-nanowire films were controlled by the number of layers deposited. Both transverse and longitudinal surface plasmon (SP) modes of the silver-nanowires were observed in the absorbance spectra, as was evidence for nanowire interaction. Two-dimensional finite difference time-domain (2D FDTD) simulations predict that the maximum field enhancement occurs at the ends and cross-sectional edges of the wires for the longitudinal and transverse modes, respectively. Silver nanowires were synthesized by a facile, high-yield solvothermal approach, which can be easily manipulated to control the aspect ratio of the nanowires. The effects of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) concentration and molecular weight on the growth of the silver nanowires, which are not documented in the original procedure, are discussed. It is shown that the growth mechanism for silver nanowires in the solvothermal synthesis is similar to that reported for the polyol synthesis.",

The UV\u2013visible absorption spectra and scanning electron microscopy have been used to trace the growth process of the Ag nanowires. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy investigation further shows that the PVP molecules are adsorbed on the surface of the Ag nanowires through Ag\u2009:\u2009O coordination. Comparing with the growth process of Ag nanoparticles, a possible growth mechanism of the Ag nanowires has been proposed. It is implied that the PVP molecules are used as both a protecting agent and a structure-directing agent for the growth of Ag nanowires. It is concluded that the five-fold twinning Ag nanoparticles are formed through heterogenous nucleation after the introduction of Pt nanoparticle seeds and then grow anisotropically along the lang110rang direction, while the growth along lang100rang is relatively depressed.",

Sizing was enabled using an\nAMT Kodak Megaplus digital camera and software. Samples were prepared for\nelectron microscopy by evaporating 1 lL of nanoparticle solution (at 25 \ue055C) on\nformvar-coated copper grids.\nFor gold-seed production, 0.5 mL of 0.01 M HAuCl\n4\ntrihydrate in water and\n0.5 mL of 0.01 M sodium citrate in water were added to 18 mL of deionized\nH\n2\nO and stirred. Next, 0.5 mL of freshly-prepared 0.1 M NaBH\n4\nwas added\nand the solution color changed from colorless to orange. Stirring was stopped\nand the solution was left undisturbed for 2 h. The resulting spherical gold nano-\nparticles were 4 nm in diameter and were active for 2\u00b16 h after preparation.\nFor gold nanorod growth from the seeds, three flasks were labeled A, B, and\nC. Growth solutions A and B consisted of 9 mL of 0.1 M cetyltrimethylammo-\nnium bromide (CTAB) in water (for nanorods with aspect ratio of ~ 20, heptane\nwas added to make a final heptane concentration of 0.1 M), 0.25 mL of\n0.010 M HAuCl\n4\ntrihydrate in water, 50 lL of 0.1 M ascorbic acid, then 50 lL\nof 0.1 M NaOH (for the production of nanorods with an aspect ratio of ~ 25 the\nvolume of NaOH was doubled to 100 lL). Growth solution C was prepared\nwith 90 mL of 0.1 M CTAB, 2.5 mL of 0.01 M HAuCl\n4\n, 0.5 mL of 0.1 M ascor-\nbic acid, then 0.5 mL of 0.1 M NaOH.\nTo grow the gold nanorods, 1.0 mL of the seed solution was added to growth\nsolution A. Growth solution A was shaken for approximately 3\u00b15 s and 1.0 mL\nof solution A was added into B. Solution B was shaken for ~ 3\u00b15 s, then all of B\nwas poured into growth solution C. The solution color of C changed from color-\nless to a reddish brown and was allowed to sit overnight. To separate the gold nanorods from spherical side products, four 10 mL por-\ntions of solution C were centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 20 min; the supernatant\nfluid was then poured off and 100 lL of water was added to the precipitate in\neach tube to redisperse it. 1 lL of this solution was evaporated on a formvar-\ncoated copper grid and imaged with TEM."

Then the seed particles are added to a growth\nsolution containing HAuCl\n4\n, ascorbic acid, and hexadecyl-trim-\nethylammonium bromide (CTAB).\n14\nAscorbic acid rapidly reduces\nthe gold salt from its Au(III) to Au(I) state, leading to a colorless,\nmeta-stable solution at room temperature. The addition of seeds\ninduces\nin situ\nautocatalytic reduction of Au(I), thus enlarging the\nseed particles. CTAB is used as a structural directing agent for\nproducing nanorods, likely due to the stabilization of the side surface\nfrom preferential adsorption on the (100) surface.\n15\nThe diameters\nof such made gold nanorods were typically less than 10 nm with\nan aspect ratio smaller than 10.\n13,14\nLater a three-step seeding\napproach was reported to yield nanorods with an aspect ratio of up\nto 18.5,\n13\nwhich was further extended to\n>\n20.\n16,17\nThus it appears\nthat longer nanorods can be obtained if one can further extend the\ngrowth. In an analogy to radical polymerization, if the number of\nthe initiator sites (seed) is reduced, a longer polymer chain\n(nanowires) should be obtained. Therefore, we set out to do\nsynthesis using significantly less seeds. We also discovered that\nnanowire growth was promoted in acidic solution.

Both electrodes are immersed in an\nelectrolytic solution consisting of a cationic surfactant, hexadecyltrimethylammonium\nbromide (C16TAB, 99%; Sigma), and\na rod-inducing cosurfactant. The C16TAB serves not only as\nthe supporting electrolyte but also as the stabilizer for nanoparticles\nto prevent their further growth. During the synthesis,\nthe bulk gold metal is converted from the anode to form gold\nnanoparticles most probably at the interfacial region of the\ncathodic surface and within the electrolytic solution. A\ncontrolled-current electrolysis is used throughout the process\nfor a typical current of 3 mA and a typical electrolysis time of 30 min. The synthesis is conducted under an ultrasonication\nand a controlled temperature, typically at 38 \u00b0C.\nAn appropriate amount of acetone added into the electrolytic\nsolution is necessary. The growth mechanism of Au nanorods\nis still not known at this stage; however, evidences suggest that\nthe role of acetone is to facilitate the incorporation of cylindricalshaped-\ninducing cosurfactant into the C16TAB micellar framework\nand inducing the cylindrical growth to form the Au-\nC16TAB-TC8AB system. The typical rod-inducing cosurfactant\nemployed is an overall much more hydrophobic cationic\nsurfactant: tetraoctylammonium bromide (TC8AB, >98%;\nFluka).

  "abstract": "Gold nanorods were prepared via a seed-mediated sequential growth process involving the use of citratestabilised\nseed crystals and their subsequent growth in a series of reaction solutions containing [AuCl4]2,\nascorbic acid and the cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonuim bromide (CTAB). Electron diffraction\nanalysis and HRTEM images of mature nanorods showed superpositions of two specific pairs of\ncrystallographic zones, either v112w and v100w or v110w and v111w, which were consistent with a\ncyclic penta-twinned crystal with five {111} twin boundaries arranged radially to the [110] direction of\nelongation. The nanorods have an idealised 3-D prismatic morphology with ten {111} end faces and five {100}\nor {110} side faces, or both. TEM studies of crystals at various stages of growth indicated that the seed crystals\nare initially transformed by growth and aggregation into decahedral penta-twinned crystals, 4% of which\nbecome elongated when a fresh reaction solution is added, whilst the remaining twins grow isometrically.\nReiteration of this procedure increases the length of the existing nanorods, induces further transformation of\nisometric particles to produce a second (and third) population of shorter, wider nanorods, and increases the\nsize of the isometric crystals. The data indicate that symmetry breaking in fcc metallic structures to produce\nanisotropic nanoparticles is based on an intrinsic structural mechanism (twinning) that is subsequently\nmodulated extrinsically during growth in solution by specific adsorption of AuI\u2013surfactant complexes on the\nside faces/edges of the isometric penta-twinned crystals and which is responsible for the preferential growth\nalong the common [110] axis. We propose that the coupling of multiple twinning and habit modification is a\ngeneral mechanism that applies to other experimental procedures (electrochemical, inverse micellar media)\ncurrently used to prepare metallic nanoparticles with a high aspect ratio.",

Addition of the ascorbic acid turned\nthe solution from brown-yellow to colourless suggesting that\nthe Au(III) complexes were initially reduced to aqueous Au(I)\nanions,28 such as [AuCl2]2, rather than Au (0). The mixture was\nleft for 24 h before similarly reducing the Au (III) solution in a\nsecond test-tube (tube 2) with ascorbic acid, and then adding\n1 ml of the aged solution from tube 1. This procedure was then\nrepeated after a further 24 h such that successive transfers of\n1 ml of aged solutions into freshly reduced solutions proceeded\nfrom tube 2 to 3, and then from 3 to 4. Doubly distilled water\nwas used throughout the experiments and all glassware was\ncleaned with aqua regia."

The\nsolution was irradiated with a 254-nm UV light (420 \u00edW/cm2) for\nabout 30 h. The resulting solution was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for\n10 min, and the supernatant was collected, which was centrifuged\nagain at 10000 rpm for 10 min. The precipitate was collected and\nredispersed in deionized water. The color of the resulting solution\nvaries with the amount of silver ions added, which is indicative of\ngold nanorods with different aspect ratios. Figure 1 shows various\nsolutions prepared with different amounts of silver ion addition and\ntheir corresponding UV-vis spectra. The leftmost solution is\nproduced when no silver ion solution is added and consists of mostly\nspherical particles with a very small amount of gold nanorods. Its\nUV-vis spectrum exhibits a single absorption peak at 530 nm.\nWhen silver ions are added, gold nanorods are formed which can\nbe seen from the additional absorption peak due to the longitudinal\nsurface plasmon in the UV-vis spectrum. Typically their UV-vis\nspectra show one transversal surface plasma peak at 520 nm and\nlongitudinal ones at 600-800 nm."

  "abstract": "A method is used for preparing gold NRs with aspect ratios ranging from 1.5 to 10 for\nwhich the surface plasmon absorption maxima are between 600 and 1300 nm. This method\nhas been adapted from a previously published seed-mediated growth method (Jana et al.\nAdv. Mater. 2001, 13, 1389). The disadvantages and limitations of the earlier method (i.e.,\nformation of noncylindrical NRs,  -shaped particles, and formation of a large fraction of\nspherical particles) have been overcome by use of a hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide\n(CTAB)-capped seed instead of a citrate-capped one. In a single-component surfactant system,\nthe silver content of the growth solution was used to grow NRs to a desired length. This\nresults in reproducible formation of NRs with aspect ratios ranging from 1.5 to 4.5. To grow\nlonger NRs with aspect ratios ranging from 4.6 to 10, a binary surfactant mixture composed\nof benzyldimethylhexadecylammoniumchloride (BDAC) and CTAB was used. NRs are grown\nin this mixture either by aging or by addition of a growth solution suitable to shorter NRs.\nEffects of the silver ion and the cosurfactant along with the growth mechanism of NRs are\ndiscussed.",

  "experimental": "Seed Solution. CTAB solution (5 mL, 0.20 M) was mixed\nwith 5.0 mL of 0.00050MHAuCl4. To the stirred solution, 0.60\nmL of ice-cold 0.010 M NaBH4 was added, which resulted in\nthe formation of a brownish yellow solution. Vigorous stirring\nof the seed solution was continued for 2 min. After the solution\nwas stirred, it was kept at 25 \u00b0C.\nGrowth of NRs with Plasmon Bands Less Than 850\nnm. CTAB (5 mL, 0.20 M) was added to (0.050, 0.10, 0.15,\n0.20, 0.25 mL) of 0.0040 M AgNO3 solution at 25 \u00b0C. To this\nsolution, 5.0 mL of 0.0010 M HAuCl4 was added, and after\ngentle mixing of the solution 70 \u00edL of 0.0788 M ascorbic acid\nwas added. Ascorbic acid as a mild reducing agent changes\nthe growth solution from dark yellow to colorless. It is worth\nnoting that the five growth solutions above are identical except\nfor their silver ion content.\nThe final step was the addition of 12 \u00edL of the seed solution\nto the growth solution at 27-30 \u00b0C. The color of the solution\ngradually changed within 10-20 min. For longer NRs, the\ncolor change takes place more slowly. The temperature of the\ngrowth medium was kept constant at 27-30 \u00b0C in all the\nexperiments. This pathway produces pure NR solutions with\naspect ratios up to 4.7.\nGrowth of NRs with Plasmon Bands Longer Than 850\nnm. Two strategies were used to grow longer NRs. In both\ncases a binary surfactant mixture of benzyldimethylhexadecylammoniumchloride\n(BDAC) and CTAB was used.\nIn the first approach the surfactant mixture was prepared\nby adding 5 mL of 0.15 M BDAC to 0.010, 0.030, 0.050, 0.080,\n0.10, 0.12, and 0.20 g of CTAB for making surfactant mixtures\nwith ratios of 27 to 1.3. After dissolving the mixtures by\nsonication (20 min at 40 \u00b0C), each solution was added to 200\n\u00edL of 0.0040 M AgNO3. In these solutions the silver content\nwas kept constant while the fraction of the cosurfactant\n(CTAB) was changed. To this solution, 5.0 mL of 0.0010 M\nHAuCl4 was added, and after gentle mixing of the solution 70\n\u00edL of 0.0778 M ascorbic acid was added. The growth process\ncompleted 1 h after addition of a 12-\u00edL seed. At this stage NRs\nwith aspect ratios of 5-5.5 are formed. By aging the NR\nsolution for 7 days, the aspect ratio increases to 9-10. It was\nfound that the BDAC/CTAB ratios between 2 and 5.5 produce\nfewer spherical particles relative to the larger surfactant\nratios. The color of the solution could change from red to light\nbrown due to high or low concentration of NSs, respectively.\nIn the second approach, the growth solution with a BDAC/\nCTAB molar ratio of 2.7 was made as described above (called\nA). This ratio was selected because it favors the formation of\nfewer NSs relative to other ratios. The growth process was\ninitiated after adding 12 \u00edL of seed solution.\nThe growth solution (called B) was prepared by adding 5.0\nmL of a mixture of 0.15 M BDAC and 0.10 g of CTAB to 200\n\u00edL of 0.0040 M AgNO3. This solution was then added to 5.0\nmL of 0.00050 M HAuCl4 solution. To this solution, 36 \u00edL of\n0.0778Mascorbic acid was added, which resulted in a colorless\nsolution. The growth solution (B) was added to solution A at\na rate of 1.0 mL per 20 min. Each addition of the growth\nsolution redshifted the plasmon band by about 20-30 nm. This\nprocess can be continued until the desired NR length is\nobtained."

  "abstract": "We report studies on the synthesis of gold nanorods by a three-step seeding protocol method\nusing a variety of different gold seeds. The synthetic method is adapted from one we published\nearlier (Jana et al. J. Phys. Chem. B 2001, 105, 4065). The seeds chosen for these studies\nhave average diameters in the range from 4 to 18 nm, with positively charged as well as\nnegatively charged surface groups. In all the cases, along with a large concentration of long\nrods, a small number of different shapes such as triangles, hexagons, and small rods are\nobserved. The proportion of small rods increases with an increase in the seed size used for\nnanorod synthesis. For long nanorods synthesized by different seeds a comparison of various\nparameters such as length, width, and aspect ratio has been made. A dependence of the\nnanorod aspect ratio on the size of the seed is observed. Increasing the seed size results in\nlowering of the gold nanorod aspect ratios for a constant concentration of reagents. The\ncharge on the seed also plays a role in determining the nanorod aspect ratio. For positively\ncharged seeds variation in the aspect ratio is not as pronounced as that for negatively charged\nseeds. The gold nanorods synthesized were characterized by transmission electron microscopy\n(TEM), UV-vis spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The role of seed\nsize in the size and shape evolution of the nanocrystal, at different growth stages, has been\nstudied by TEM.",

  "experimental": "Gold nanorods were synthesized\nby the three-step seeding protocol as described\npreviously.18 Specifically, two 20 mL conical flasks and one\n100 mL conical flask (labeled A, B, and C, respectively) were\ntaken. To these flasks were added 9 mL (in flasks A and B)\nand 45 mL (in flask C) of growth solution containing a mixture\nof 2.5   10-4 M HAuCl4 and 0.1 M CTAB solutions. To these\nsolutions were added 50 \u00edL (flasks A and B) and 250 \u00edL (flask\nC) of 0.1 M freshly prepared ascorbic acid, and the resulting\nsolutions were stirred gently. The orange color of the gold salt\nin the CTAB solution disappeared when ascorbic acid was\nadded. We have attributed this color change to the reduction\nof Au3+ to Au+. However, the reduction of Au+ to Au0 does not\noccur, and we do not observe the gold plasmon band indicative\nof Au0 nanoparticles even after 24 h. This indicates that\nascorbic acid is too weak to reduce Au+ under our experimental\nconditions. However, further reduction of Au+ to Au0 occurs\nwhen 1.0 mL of the seed solution is mixed with sample A (step\n1). This is evidenced by a rapid development of red color to\nthe solution in sample A, which earlier was colorless, thus\nindicating the formation of gold nanoparticles. After 15 s, 1.0\nmL of sample A was mixed with sample B (step 2). This leads\nto a color change in sample B, indicating the generation of\ngold nanoparticles. The reduction in this case is slower\ncompared to that in step 1. A 5.0 mL portion of sample B was\nfurther added to sample C after 30 s (step 3). The color of this\nsolution slowly changed to purple. In all cases, each flask was\ngently stirred to homogenize the solutions. The solution in\nflask C was kept at 25 \u00b0C for a period of 16 h."

  "experimental": "I. Preparation of 3.5 nm Seed. A 20 mL aqueous solution\ncontaining 2.5   10-4 M HAuCl4 and 2.5   10-4 M tri-sodium\ncitrate was prepared in a conical flask. Next, 0.6 mL of ice cold\n0.1 M NaBH4 solution was added to the solution all at once\nwhile stirring. The solution turned pink immediately after adding\nNaBH4, indicating particle formation. The particles in this\nsolution were used as seeds within 2-5 h after preparation. The\naverage particle size measured from the transmission electron\nmicrograph was 3.5 ( 0.7 nm. Some irregular and aggregated\nparticles were also observed that were not considered for\ndetermining the size distribution. Here, citrate serves only as\nthe capping agent since it cannot reduce gold salt at room\ntemperature (25 \u00b0C). Experiments performed in the absence of\ncitrate resulted in particles approximately 7-10 nm in diameter.\nII. Preparation of 4.6 ( 1 Aspect Ratio Rod. In a clean\ntest tube, 10 mL of growth solution, containing 2.5   10-4 M\nHAuCl4 and 0.1 M cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB),\nwas mixed with 0.05 mL of 0.1 M freshly prepared ascorbic\nacid solution. Next, 0.025 mL of the 3.5 nm seed solution was\nadded. No further stirring or agitation was done. Within 5-10\nmin, the solution color changed to reddish brown. The solution\ncontained 4.6 aspect ratio rods, spheres, and some plates. The\nsolution was stable for more than one month.\nIII. Preparation of 13 ( 2 Aspect Ratio Rod. A three-step\nseeding method was used for this nanorod preparation. Three\ntest tubes (labeled A, B, and C), each containing 9 mL growth\nsolution, consisting of 2.5   10-4 M HAuCl4 and 0.1 M CTAB,\nwere mixed with 0.05 mL of 0.1 M ascorbic acid. Next, 1.0\nmL of the 3.5 nm seed solution was mixed with sample A. The\ncolor of A turned red within 2-3 min. After 4-5 h, 1.0 mL\nwas drawn from solution A and added to solution B, followed\nby thorough mixing. The color of solution B turned red within\n4-5 min. After 4-5 h, 1 mL of B was mixed with C. Solution\nC turned red in color within 10 min. All of the solutions were\nstable for more than a month. Solution C contained gold\nnanorods with aspect ratio 13.\nIV. Preparation of 18 ( 2.5 Aspect Ratio Rod. This\nprocedure was similar to the method for preparing 13 aspect\nratio rods. The only difference was the timing of seed addition\nin successive steps. For 13 aspect ratio rods, the seed or solutions\nA and B were added to the growth solution after the growth\noccurring in the previous reaction was complete. But to make\n18 aspect ratio rods, particles from A and B were transferred to\nthe growth solution while the particles in these solution were\nstill growing. Typically, solution A was transferred to B after\n15 s of adding 3.5 nm seed to A, and solution B was transferred\nto C after 30 s of adding solution A to B.\nV. Procedure for Shape Separation. Long rods were\nconcentrated and separated from spheres and surfactant by\ncentrifugation. 10 mL of the particle solution was centrifuged\nat 2000 rpm for 6 min. The supernatant, containing mostly\nspheres, was removed and the solid part containing rods and\nsome plates was redispersed in 0.1 mL water.\nAbsorption spectra of the particle dispersions were measured\nusing a CARY 500 Scan UV-vis NIR spectrophotometer."

  "abstract": "A chiral reagent, 2-naphthol, has been introduced under alkaline solution as a\nreductant for HAuCl4 in CTAB micelle to produce exclusively cubic gold\nnanoparticles under UV photoactivation. Prolonged irradiation helped the\ndigestion of the primarily evolved spherical particles into smaller gold\nnanocubes, which then act as tiny cubic seeds, leading to the formation of\nlarger nanocubes. The smaller cubes take the assistance of CTAB under\nalkaline condition to serve as the seed in directing the transformation of all\nthe spherical colloids into cubic shapes under continuous irradiation via\nOstwald ripening. The shape transformation of the nanoparticles has been\nmonitored by repetitive TEM imaging and absorption spectral analysis. The\nFTIR analysis proves that the gold nanocubes are capped by CTAB. The\nXRD pattern authenticates the formation of the fcc gold nanocubes. GCMS\nstudies in turn confirmed the presence of hydroxylation of 2-naphthol in the\ncourse of the reaction, leaving exclusively cubic gold nanoparticles at the\nfinal stage of the photoactivation reaction.",

  "experimental": "The device configuration of electrochemical preparation is\nshown schematically in Fig. 1. The bulk gold at the anode is\noxidized to gold cations which then migrate to the cathode\nwhere reduction reaction occurs with the formation of gold adatoms\non cathode surface during the electrochemical process.\nThe ultrasonication was used to restrain the gold ad-atoms\ndeposition as film on cathode surface during the electrolysis.\nThese gold ad-atoms in the growth solution are trapped by the\nsurfactant to form the nanoparticle. The surfactant as the\nelectrolyte and stabilizer is generally considered to be a micelletemplate\nto control the size and shape of particle. In this work,\nthe acetone solvent was injected to the electrolyte solution with\nsurfactant and they cause the changing of surfactant micelletemplate,\nleading to the gold nanocube structures. In typical\nsynthesis, the gold nanocubes were formed in a simple twoelectrode\ncell using a power supply (MOTECH LPS-305,\nTaiwan). The actual experimental cell was housed in a\nconventional 20\u00d780 mm glass test tube. Gold and platinum\nplates were cut to dimensions of 30\u00d710\u00d70.5 mm, to form the\nanode and the cathode, respectively. The gold plate and the\nplatinum plate, both 99.99% pure, were purchased from the\nGredmann Corporation. These two electrodes were placed\nvertically, face-to-face inside the cell. The electrodes in the cell\nwere 5 mm apart and held in place by Teflon spacers. The surfactant\ncetyltrimethylammonium bromide (C19H42BrN; CTAB,\n98%, Fluka) (0.08 M) served as the electrolytic growth solution,\nof which 3 mL was put in the glass test tube. Then, 25.2 mg of\npowdered auxiliary surfactant tetradecyltrimethylammonium\nbromide (C48H100BrN; TTAB, 99%, Fluka) was added to the\nsame test tube, where it floated on the growth solution. A pipette\nwas then used to add 0.95 mL of acetone (99%, J. T. Baker)\nsolvent on the top of the solution, after which the test tube was\nsonicated at 40 kHz for 5 min. Electrolysis was carried out\nunder constant ultrasonication (ELMA T710DH, Germany) at\n40 kHz for 5 min. During the electrolysis, the acetone solvent\nwas simultaneously injected into the growth solution at a rate of\n0.125 mL min\u22121. The typical current was set to 5 mA, and the\ntemperature was held constant at 36 \u00b0C. TEM, SAED and EDX\nwere performed using a Tecnai-F20 field emission electron\nmicroscope with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV (Philips) to\nanalyze the gold nanocubes. The X-ray diffraction (XRD)\npattern was obtained on a MAC Science (MXT-III) instrument\noperated at 40 kVand a current of 30 mAwith Cu K\u03b1 radiation a\n(\u03bb=1.54178 \u00c5)."

The standard method, as described by\nTurkevich and Frens, is reduction by citrate at 100 \u00b0C. The\nreduction of a gold hydrochlorate solution (Chempur, 99%) has\nbeen initiated by sodium tris-citrate (Merck) by bringing gold\nsolution to a boil in a double-walled reactor, which is heated\nby a bath thermostat. The mantle assured a very homogeneous\ntemperature distribution within the reaction solution. The liquid\nis vigorously stirred by Teflon-coated magnetic bars. No\nrefluxing was utilized in order to prevent the presence of\ntemperature gradients in the liquid. When the solution (95 mL)\nstarted to boil, 5 mL of preheated citrate solution was added.\nThe citrate concentration was varied to achieve different particle\nsizes. After a defined time (normally 15 min), the liquid was\nextracted and cooled to room temperature. In addition, the reduction can be achieved at room temperature\nafter initiation by UV irradiation. A PMMA UV cuvette (5 mm\npath length) was filled with 2 mL of gold hydrochlorate solution\nwith added amounts of citrate. After stirring, the cuvette was\nplaced in front of a UV lamp with an emission around 366 nm\n(15 W, Roth GmbH). The fluence of the lamp was measured to\nbe about 1 mW/cm2. After an exposure time from 2 to 120 min,\nthe cuvette was placed in the spectrometer and spectra were\nmeasured repeatedly.\nThe third possibility is the reduction by ascorbic acid (similar\nresults for sodium ascorbate) at room temperature. A solution\nof gold hydrochlorate was stirred in a reactor (49 mL), and 1\nmL of ascorbic acid was added rapidly. The extinction spectra\nwere recorded with varied delays from the mixing. For the insitu\nspectroscopy, 1 mL of gold hydrochlorate solution was\nrapidly mixed with 1 mL of a solution of ascorbic acid directly\nin the cuvette, placed in the light path of the spectrometer.\nA set of varying gold concentrations was tested to obtain the\nstability limits of the reaction."

  "abstract": "We report a nanowire growth that is highly unconventional: (1)\nnanowires can grow from substrate-bound seeds but cannot from colloidal seeds\nunder otherwise the same conditions; (2) the nanowires grow from only one side of\nthe seeds, with their diameter independent of the size of the seeds; and (3)\nvertically aligned ultrathin nanowires are obtained on substrates, using aqueous\nsolution and ambient conditions. With carefully designed experiments, we propose\nand test a new mechanism that can explain these unusual phenonmena. It turns\nout that the strong binding of ligands in this system forces selective deposition of\nAu at the ligand-deficient interface between Au seeds and oxide substrates. This means of promoting anisotropic growth of nanocrystals into nanowires is\npreviously unknown in the literature. We are able to pinpoint the site of active growth and explain the control of nanowire width. The sustained growth at\nthe active site and the inhibited growth at its parameter push the nanocrystals upward into wires; their diameter is dependent on the dynamic competition\nof the two processes. The site-specific growth from substrate-anchored seeds provides a rare means to create substrate-nanowire hierarchical structures in\naqueous solution under ambient conditions. Rendering a surface conductive, particularly one with complex surface morphology, is now made easy.",

  "experimental": "To prepare the vertical\nAuNWs on a Si/SiO2 wafer, a Si wafer (about 0.6 cm2) was\npretreated with O2 plasma for 10 min to improve its surface\nhydrophilicity. The wafer was then functionalized with an amino\ngroup by reacting with APTES solution (5 mM) for 1 h.46\nSubsequently, the wafer was soaked in excess citrate-stabilized\nAu seeds (3!5 nm) solution for 2 h to ensure the adsorption of\nAu seeds and rinsed with water twice to remove the excess Au\nseeds. The seeds-adsorbed wafer was then immersed in a\nreaction solution containing the ligand MBA (550 \u03bcM), HAuCl4\n(1.7 mM), and L-ascorbic acid (4.1 mM) for 15 min. Finally, the\nwafer was rinsed with ethanol and dried in air. The SEM image of\nthe product was shown in Figure 1a. The generation of a thin\nconductive film on Si/SiO2 wafer is similar to that of vertical\nAuNWs. All reaction conditions were unchanged except that the\nsubstrate was first functionalized with an amino group by\nreacting with lower APTES solution (10 \u03bcM) for 0.5 h.\nFor preparingAuNWswith 15 nmAuNPs as seeds (Figure1d,e),\nall reaction conditions were unchanged except that citratestabilized\nAuNPs with a diameter of 15 nm were used as\nseeds56,57 during the incubation with the amino-functionalized\nSi wafer.\nTo investigate the concentration-dependent growth of\nAuNWs, two sets of experiments were carried out: (a) Varying\nthe ligand concentration. For the preparation of AuNWs or\nspherical NPs on Si/SiO2 (Figure 3b!d), all reaction conditionswere\nunchanged except that the concentration of MBA was lowered to\n55 \u03bcM, 28 \u03bcM, and 5.5 \u03bcM, respectively; (b) Varying the concentration\nof HAuCl4 and L-ascorbic acid (their relative ratio was kept\nunchanged). For the preparation of AuNWs or spherical NPs on Si/\nSiO2 (Supporting Information, Figure S4a!c), all reaction conditions\nwere unchanged except that the concentration of HAuCl4\nand L-ascorbic acid was lowered to (a) 0.6 mM and 1.4 mM, (b)\n1.7 mM and 4.1 mM, and (c) 8.6 mM and 20.7 mM, respectively. To identify the site of AuNW growth, a two-stage reaction\nwas carried out. The substrate was first grown in a solution of\n550 \u03bcM MBA for 5 min, and then rapidly transferred without\ndrying to a solution of 28 \u03bcMMBA and grown for another 5 min.\nThe concentrations of HAuCl4 (1.7 mM) and L-ascorbic acid\n(4.1 mM) were constant in both stages. The resulting AuNWs\nhad thin heads and thick tails (Figure 3e). Conversely, when the\ngrowth was carried out first with a low concentration of MBA\n(55 \u03bcM) and then with a high concentration (550 \u03bcM), the\nresulting AuNWs had thick heads and thin tails (Figure 3g). This\nphenomenon was also observed by changing the concentrations\nof HAuCl4 and L-ascorbic acid with fixed ligand concentration\nas shown in Supporting Information, Figure S4d,e."

  "experimental": "Synthesis of CTAB Stabilized Pt NCs Seeds. The\nsynthesis of 3 nm Pt NCs stabilized in CTAB was carried out\nfollowing the method described by Grzelczak et al.24 A mixture\nof 9.63 mL of CTAB 0.1 M with 50 \u03bcL of K2PtCl4 0.05 M was\nheated up to 40 \u00b0C for 5 min until the solution became clear.\nAfter adding 0.3 mL of NaBH4 0.06 M, the vial was capped\nimmediately. After 10 min, the vial was opened and stirred for\nseveral minutes until the decomposition of the NaBH4. NC\nconcentration was of \u223c5 \u00d7 1014 NC/mL, in agreement with\nthose previously reported for Au seeds.25\nSynthesis of CTAB Stabilized Au NCs Seeds. The\nsynthesis of Au NCs stabilized in CTAB were prepared via the\nmethod developed by Nikoobakht and El-Sayed.16 Briefly, 5\nmL CTAB solution 0.2 M was mixed with 5 mL of HAuCl4\nsolution 0.0005 M. Next, 0.6 mL of freshly prepared NaBH4\n0.01 M was added to the mixture while vigorously stirring,\nwhich resulted in the formation of a light-brown solution within\nfew seconds. Stirring of the solution was continued for 2 min.\nSynthesis of Au NRs with Pt Seeds. Growth solution was\nprepared by mixing 5 mL of CTAB 0.2 M and 5 mL of HAuCl4\n0.001 M. After that, 50 \u03bcL of AA 0.1 M was added as a mild\nreducing agent, changing the growth solution from dark yellow\nto colorless. Then, a volume between 5 and 30 \u03bcL of the\npresynthesized Pt seeds was added and gently mixed for 10 s.\nThe solution was kept at RT without stirring for 1 month. The\nevolution of the reaction was followed by UV\u2212vis, ICP-MS,\nand TEM.\nSynthesis of Au NRs with Au Seeds. Three different\nvolumes (0.015, 0.15, and 1.5 mL) of K2PtCl4 solution 0.004 M\nwere added to 5 mL CTAB solution 0.2 M. Then, 5 mL of\nHAuCl4 0.001 M and 55 \u03bcL of AA 0.1 M were added\nsimultaneously to the solutions dropwise, and then gently\nmixed for 10 s. It is worth noting that the three solutions above\nare identical except for the Pt ion content. The final step was\nthe addition of 12 \u03bcL of the presynthesized Au NC seed\nsolution to the growth solutions. The solutions were kept at\nRT."

  "abstract": "We report an improved synthesis of colloidal gold nanorods (NRs) by using aromatic additives\nthat reduce the concentration of hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide surfactant to\n\u223c0.05 M as opposed to 0.1 M in well-established protocols. The method optimizes the\nsynthesis for each of the 11 additives studied, allowing a rich array of monodisperse gold NRs\nwith longitudinal surface plasmon resonance tunable from 627 to 1246 nm to be generated.\nThe gold NRs form large-area ordered assemblies upon slow evaporation of NR solution,\nexhibiting liquid crystalline ordering and several distinct local packing motifs that are\ndependent upon the NR's aspect ratio. Tailored synthesis of gold NRs with simultaneous\nimprovements in monodispersity and dimensional tunability through rational introduction of\nadditives will not only help to better understand the mechanism of seed-mediated growth of\ngold NRs but also advance the research on plasmonic metamaterials incorporating anisotropic\nmetal nanostructures.",

  "experimental": "Synthesis of Gold NRs with LSPRs Less than 700 nm Using\nSalicylate-Based Sodium Salts. Seed-mediated growth in\nthe presence of the cationic surfactant CTAB has been\ncontinuously improved since its first demonstration by\nMurphy et al. and is now widely adopted for the\npreparation of gold NRs.29,31 The NRs obtained typically\nexhibit LSPRs greater than 700 nm, corresponding\nto a NR aspect ratio larger than \u223c2.8. Preparation of\ngold NRs of relatively small aspect ratio has been\ndemonstrated using mild oxidation with Au(III) CTAB\ncomplexes,58 O2 or H2O2 in an acidic environment,59,60\nanisotropic chemical etching with cyanide or ferric\nchloride,61,62 laser-induced thermal heating,63 and\ncontrolled overgrowth of preformed gold NRs.60,64\nHowever, these postsynthetic modification strategies\nusually offer limited control over size and shape uniformity\nof the final products, and thus a one-step\nsynthesis of monodisperse short gold NRs with LSPRs\nin the visible region is still desirable.\nTo grow short gold NRs, here we report the use of\nsalicylate-based organic salts as the additive together\nwith CTAB (\u223c0.05 M in the growth solution) whose\nconcentration has been reduced by 50% compared to\nthe standard recipes (0.1 M). It has been widely\naccepted that the hydrophobic benzene ring of the\nadditive tends to penetrate into the hydrophobic alkyl\nchain of the CTAB monomer. Meanwhile, the salicylate\nanion can orient in such a way that the negatively\ncharged COO  group stands perpendicular to the\nsurfactant and projects radially from the surface of\nthe micelle into the bulk aqueous solution.54,55 These\ntwo factors change synergistically the micellar packing\nparameter p = v/Al, where v is the effective volume of\nthe hydrophobic chain, A is the effective area of the\npolar headgroup, and l is the length of the hydrocarbon\nchain.52 Insertion of the phenyl moiety of the salts\nincreases the v of the CTAB micelle. Anion association\nreduces the micellar surface charge and decreases A by\nreducing the electrostatic repulsion between the quaternary\nammonium groups, promoting the spherical to\nrodlike micellar transition. In this work, the two aromatic\nsalt additives tested for gold NR synthesis are\nsodium 3-methylsalicylate and sodium salicylate.\nFigures 1a,b and S2 show the TEM images of gold NRs\nsynthesized with 0.0126 M sodium 3-methylsalicylate\npresent in the growth solution. The NRs obtained have\nan average diameter of 14.0 ( 1.0 nm and a length of\n33.0 ( 2.5 nm (corresponding to an aspect ratio\nof \u223c2.4), giving rise to a LSPR peak centered at about\n627 nm. On the other hand, slightly longer NRs are\nmade when 0.010 M sodium salicylate is used as the\nadditive. As shown in Figures 1d,e and S3, the NRs\nexhibit average dimensions of 14.0 ( 1.2 nm in diameter\nand 36.0 ( 2.5 nm in length (corresponding to\nan aspect ratio of \u223c2.6), resulting in a LSPR band\naround 653 nm. In both cases, the level of shape\nimpurities such as spherical nanoparticles or nanoplates\nin as-synthesized samples is dramatically lower\nthan those of previous gold NR preparations using\nsilver-assisted seed-mediated growth, which is also\nevidenced by the strong, sharp LSPR peaks in the\nensemble extinction spectra (Figure 1g). HRTEM\nimages (Figure 1c,f) indicate that gold NRs grown in\nthe presence of aromatic sodium salt additives are\nsingle-crystalline with a [001] growth direction. It is\nworth pointing out that recent crystallographic studies\nof gold NRs showed that the side facets of gold\nnanorods are dominated by high-index planes.65,66"

  "abstract": "Gold nanorods (AuNRs) were obtained via a wet chemistry technique, in aqueous medium,\nemploying crystallisation seeds. The kinetics of formation, the aspect ratio, and the\nselectivity of the particles were evaluated according to the parameters of synthesis: the\ngrowth-driving agent, seed, and gold precursor concentrations. In 2\u20134 h, the rod particles\nattained the expected size and shape under kinetic control, and were stable for at least 2\ndays. In order to obtain good quality AuNRs in good yields, without enrichment, we\nsuggest keeping the growth-driving agent/gold molar ratio, the AuI/seed ratio, and the\nconcentration of the reagents in the final solution within specific ranges. For example,\neven if good molar ratios between the reagents are maintained, relatively highly\nconcentrated reaction solutions lead to AuNRs with lower aspect ratios. The main\nproperties of the prepared colloidal systems and the nanoparticles were evaluated by UV\u2013\nvis spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy, respectively.",

This solution contained ca. 1.25   1014 particles\nof 4 nm/mL, and was used in all experiments. According to the experiment, different growth solutions\nwere prepared. For example, for illustration, in a 20 mL\nglass tube, three aqueous solutions of HAuCl4 3 H2O\n(5.0 mL; 1.0 mmol/L), CTAB (2.5 mL; 0.20 mol/L), and\nAgNO3 (0.150 mL; 0.40 mmol/L) were added. Under\nstirring, an aqueous solution of AA (0.070 mL;\n0.80 mmol/L) was added all at once. Immediately, the\ncolour changed from yellow to colourless.\nFinally, the different colloids containing AuNRs were\nobtained by mixing appropriate quantities of seed and\ngrowth solutions, as well as CTAB. In a typical experiment,\nthe seed solution (12 mL) was added, under gentle stirring\nfor 10 s, into a recently prepared growth solution (7.72 mL;\n0.64 mmol/L of AuI species), and left undisturbed for at\nleast 4 h."

This method\nhas been adapted from a previously published seed-mediated growth method (Jana et al.\nAdv. Mater. 2001, 13, 1389). The disadvantages and limitations of the earlier method (i.e.,\nformation of noncylindrical NRs,  -shaped particles, and formation of a large fraction of\nspherical particles) have been overcome by use of a hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide\n(CTAB)-capped seed instead of a citrate-capped one. In a single-component surfactant system,\nthe silver content of the growth solution was used to grow NRs to a desired length. This\nresults in reproducible formation of NRs with aspect ratios ranging from 1.5 to 4.5. To grow\nlonger NRs with aspect ratios ranging from 4.6 to 10, a binary surfactant mixture composed\nof benzyldimethylhexadecylammoniumchloride (BDAC) and CTAB was used. NRs are grown\nin this mixture either by aging or by addition of a growth solution suitable to shorter NRs.\nEffects of the silver ion and the cosurfactant along with the growth mechanism of NRs are\ndiscussed.",

  "experimental": "Seed Solution. CTAB solution (5 mL, 0.20 M) was mixed\nwith 5.0 mL of 0.00050MHAuCl4. To the stirred solution, 0.60\nmL of ice-cold 0.010 M NaBH4 was added, which resulted in\nthe formation of a brownish yellow solution. Vigorous stirring\nof the seed solution was continued for 2 min. After the solution\nwas stirred, it was kept at 25 \u00b0C.\nGrowth of NRs with Plasmon Bands Less Than 850\nnm. CTAB (5 mL, 0.20 M) was added to (0.050, 0.10, 0.15,\n0.20, 0.25 mL) of 0.0040 M AgNO3 solution at 25 \u00b0C. To this\nsolution, 5.0 mL of 0.0010 M HAuCl4 was added, and after\ngentle mixing of the solution 70 \u00edL of 0.0788 M ascorbic acid\nwas added. Ascorbic acid as a mild reducing agent changes\nthe growth solution from dark yellow to colorless. It is worth\nnoting that the five growth solutions above are identical except\nfor their silver ion content.\nThe final step was the addition of 12 \u00edL of the seed solution\nto the growth solution at 27-30 \u00b0C. The color of the solution\ngradually changed within 10-20 min. For longer NRs, the\ncolor change takes place more slowly. The temperature of the\ngrowth medium was kept constant at 27-30 \u00b0C in all the\nexperiments. This pathway produces pure NR solutions with\naspect ratios up to 4.7.\nGrowth of NRs with Plasmon Bands Longer Than 850\nnm. Two strategies were used to grow longer NRs. In both\ncases a binary surfactant mixture of benzyldimethylhexadecylammoniumchloride\n(BDAC) and CTAB was used.\nIn the first approach the surfactant mixture was prepared\nby adding 5 mL of 0.15 M BDAC to 0.010, 0.030, 0.050, 0.080,\n0.10, 0.12, and 0.20 g of CTAB for making surfactant mixtures\nwith ratios of 27 to 1.3. After dissolving the mixtures by\nsonication (20 min at 40 \u00b0C), each solution was added to 200\n\u00edL of 0.0040 M AgNO3. In these solutions the silver content\nwas kept constant while the fraction of the cosurfactant\n(CTAB) was changed. To this solution, 5.0 mL of 0.0010 M\nHAuCl4 was added, and after gentle mixing of the solution 70\n\u00edL of 0.0778 M ascorbic acid was added. The growth process\ncompleted 1 h after addition of a 12-\u00edL seed. At this stage NRs\nwith aspect ratios of 5-5.5 are formed. By aging the NR\nsolution for 7 days, the aspect ratio increases to 9-10. It was\nfound that the BDAC/CTAB ratios between 2 and 5.5 produce\nfewer spherical particles relative to the larger surfactant\nratios. The color of the solution could change from red to light\nbrown due to high or low concentration of NSs, respectively.\nIn the second approach, the growth solution with a BDAC/\nCTAB molar ratio of 2.7 was made as described above (called\nA). This ratio was selected because it favors the formation of\nfewer NSs relative to other ratios. The growth process was\ninitiated after adding 12 \u00edL of seed solution.\nThe growth solution (called B) was prepared by adding 5.0\nmL of a mixture of 0.15 M BDAC and 0.10 g of CTAB to 200\n\u00edL of 0.0040 M AgNO3. This solution was then added to 5.0\nmL of 0.00050 M HAuCl4 solution. To this solution, 36 \u00edL of\n0.0778Mascorbic acid was added, which resulted in a colorless\nsolution. The growth solution (B) was added to solution A at\na rate of 1.0 mL per 20 min. Each addition of the growth\nsolution redshifted the plasmon band by about 20-30 nm. This\nprocess can be continued until the desired NR length is\nobtained."

  "abstract": "This paper investigates the role of salt in the\nspontaneous linear assembly of charged gold nanoparticles in\nethanol and attempts to clear up a misunderstanding on the role\nof ethanol in this process. Many prior reports have noted that the\naddition of ethanol to an aqueous solution of gold nanoparticles\ncauses their aggregation into linear assemblies. It was therefore\nbelieved that ethanol plays the determining role during the\nassembly process. In this work, we carried out systematic studies\nwhich indicate that residual salt in conjunction with ethanol,\ninstead of ethanol itself, induces the assembly of gold nanoparticles\nin ethanol. In the absence of salt, gold nanoparticles can be well\ndispersed in an ethanol solution. Furthermore, we find that the\nchainlike assemblies can disassemble upon dilution of the salt or\nthe evaporation of ethanol if the gold nanoparticles are protected\nwith a sufficiently strong ligand.",

However, such applications have been\nhindered by the lack of efficient synthetic methods yielding sufficient size and\nshape monodispersity, as well as by insufficient morphological stability. We\npresent here a synthesis and purification protocol that efficiently addresses these\nissues. The size of the nanotriangles can be tuned within a wide range by simply\nchanging the experimental parameters. The obtained monodispersity leads to\nextended self-assembly, not only on electron microscopy grids but also at the\nair liquid interface, allowing transfer onto centimeter-size substrates.

Excess borohydride was consumed by keeping\nthe seed solution for 2 h at room temperature prior to use.\nSynthesis of Au NTs@CTAC. In a typical synthesis of 40 mL of a Au\nNT solution the following two growth solutions were prepared:\n(1) 1.6 mL of a 0.1M CTAC solution was added to 8 mL of Milli-Q\nwater, followed by 40 \u03bcL of 0.05 M HAuCl4 solution and 15 \u03bcL of\na 0.01MNaI solution; (2) 500 \u03bcL of a 0.05MHAuCl4 solution was\nadded to 40 mL of 0.05 M CTAC, followed by 300 \u03bcL of a 0.01 M\nNaI solution. The first solution was used to grow the CTACcapped\nseed into larger nanoparticles, while the second solution\nwas used as the NT growth batch. Before proceeding, the\ninitial seed@CTAC solution was diluted 10  in a 0.1 M CTAC\nsolution. Subsequently, 40 and 400 \u03bcL of 0.1MAA solution were\nadded to solutions 1 and 2, respectively, and both solutions\nwere manually stirred until the complete transparency of the\nsolutions was achieved, indicating AuIII to AuI reduction. Finally,\n100 \u03bcL of diluted seed@CTAC solution was added to solution 1\n(and manually stirred for 1 s), and immediately 3.2 mL of this\nsolution was added to solution 2 (and manually stirred for a few\nseconds). The Au NT dispersion was left undisturbed at room\ntemperature for at least 1 h (see SI, Scheme S1, for a schematic\nrepresentation of the synthetic protocol). We observed that\naddition of 15 \u03bcL of a 0.01 M NaI solution to solution 1 further\nimproved the yield in NTs obtained with the fast addition\nprocedure."

  "abstract": "This study reports a systematic approach to\nsynthesize ultralong gold nanorods and nanowires using a\nseed-mediated growth approach. In the first series, the effect of\ngrowth solution pH on the lengths of nanorods prepared was\ninvestigated. Interestingly, although shorter rods (230\u2212310\nnm) were produced in a basic solution environment than in an\nacidic condition (330\u2212410 nm), the nanorod yield is greatly\nimproved with relatively few nanoplate byproducts formed.\nNanorod growth proceeds quickly in a basic solution as\nevidenced by the fast solution color changes. By adjusting\nseveral experimental parameters with the aim to elongate the\nnanorod length in a tunable fashion, gold nanorods and nanowires with average lengths from 580 to 2850 nm can be synthesized\nby progressively increasing the HNO3 concentration in the final growth solution. Nanowire growth in a highly acidic solution is\nslower, and a substantially longer time is needed to reach long lengths. Further extension of the nanowire length can be achieved\nsimply by reducing the volume of second growth solution transferred to the final growth solution. Nanorods and nanowires with\nlengths spanning from 700 nm to 4.5 \u03bcm were prepared in this series of experimental conditions. The longest nanowires can\nreach a length of up to 6 \u03bcm. The nanowires still maintain thin average diameters of 33\u221253 nm. The ability to make gold\nnanorods and nanowires over this exceptionally wide and useful length range is exciting because applications and demonstrations\nusing ultralong gold nanorods and nanowires of most suitable lengths are now possible.",

  "experimental": "The procedure used to\nsynthesize ultralong gold nanorods and nanowires begins with\npreparation of a seed particle solution. Scheme 1 offers a brief\nsummary of the synthesis procedure. A volume of 10 mL of aqueous\nsolution containing 0.25 mM HAuCl4 and 0.10 M CTAB was prepared\nin a 20 mL vial. Concurrently, 10 mL of 0.02 M ice-cold NaBH4 was\nfreshly made. Then 450 \u03bcL of the NaBH4 solution was introduced into\nthe CTAB\u2212HAuCl4 solution while stirring vigorously. The resulting\nsolution turned brown immediately, indicating formation of gold\nparticles. After stirring for 5 min, the solution was kept undisturbed for\n2 h at 27 \u00b0C to decompose excess borohydride by water. Seed particles\nhave sizes of a few nanometers.\nPreparation of Growth Solution. Depending on the lengths of\ngold nanorods to synthesize, slightly different growth solutions were\nprepared. First, two 25 mL flasks and one 50 mL conical flask were\nlabeled A, B, and C. For samples a\u2212f, or series I samples (see Table S1\nin the Supporting Information), 1.9681 g of CTAB, deionized water\n(52.569 mL for sample a, 52.596 mL for samples b and e, 52.623 mL\nfor samples c and d, and 52.542 mL for sample f), and 1.35 mL of 0.01\nM HAuCl4 solution were mixed. Next, various amounts of NaOH or\nHNO3 solution were added to the mixture (81, 54, and 27 \u03bcL of 0.5 M\nNaOH solution for samples a, b, and c and 27, 54, and 108 \u03bcL of 0.5\nM HNO3 solution for samples d, e, and f, respectively). At this point,\nthe total solution volume is 54 mL. CTAB and HAuCl4 concentrations\nin the growth solution are, respectively, 0.1 M and 0.25 mM excluding\nthe volume of ascorbic acid. The growth solution shows a light\nyellowish color. Then 4.5 mL of the growth solution was added to\nflasks A and B and 45 mL to flask C. Finally, 25, 25, and 250 \u03bcL of 0.1\nM ascorbic acid were, respectively, introduced into flasks A, B, and C.\nThe flasks were gently shaken until the solutions became colorless.\nFor samples g\u2212h (series II samples) and samples l\u2212p (series III\nsamples), the same procedure was adopted to make the growth\nsolution. Here a mixture of 1.093 g of CTAB, 29.475 mL of deionized\nwater, and 525 \u03bcL of 0.01 M HAuCl4 solution was made first. A\nvolume of 2.5 mL of the solution was transferred to flasks A and B and\n25 mL to flask C. CTAB and HAuCl4 concentrations in the growth\nsolution are, respectively, 0.1 M and 0.175 mM excluding the volume\nof nitric acid and ascorbic acid. Subsequently, 0.5 M HNO3 solution\nwas added to flask C only (0.0504, 0.252, 0.550, 1.1, and 3.0 mL of\nHNO3 solution for samples g, h, i, j, and k and 0.0504, 0.252, 1.1, 3.0,\nand 5.0 mL of HNO3 solution for samples l, m, n, o, and p,\nrespectively). Table 1 provides the concentrations of nitric acid in the\ngrowth solution excluding the volume of ascorbic acid. Finally, 10, 10,\nand 100 \u03bcL of 0.1 M ascorbic acid solution was introduced into flasks\nA, B, and C, respectively. Again, the flasks were gently shaken until the\nsolutions became colorless. This step would take a much longer time\nwith increasing nitric acid amount because the solution becomes more\nviscous.\nSynthesis of Utralong Gold Nanorods and Nanowires. For\nseries I, II, and III samples, 400, 200, and 200 \u03bcL of the gold seed\nsolution was, respectively, added to flask A and shaken slightly for 10 s.\nImmediately 400 (series I) and 200 \u03bcL (series II and III) of the\nsolution in flask A was transferred to flask B and shaken for 10 s.\nFinally, 4 mL (series I), 2 mL (series II), and 200 \u03bcL (series III) of the\nsolution in flask B was transferred to flask C and shaken for 5 s. Flask\nC was left undisturbed for 12 h for completion of nanorod and\nnanowire growth. The upper solution which contained mostly\nspherical particles was gently removed. Gold nanorods (or nanowires)\nand some triangular plates were left at the bottom of the flask. The\nproducts were redispersed in 10 mL of deionized water. The\nnanostructures were concentrated by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for\n20 min twice (Hermle Z323 centrifuge)."

  "abstract": "Seed-mediated growth methods involving\nreduction of tetrachloroaurate(III) with ascorbic acid\nare common for the synthesis of gold nanorods. This\nstudy shows, however, that simply by appropriate\nchoice of the reducing agent a drastic influence on the\naspect ratio can be attained. Weaker reducing agents,\nsuch as dihydroxybenzene isomers (hydroquinone,\ncatechol or resorcinol) or glucose can increase the\naspect ratio of the nanorods by an order of magnitude,\nup to values as high as 100 (nanowires). The increase\nin aspect ratio is mainly a consequence of an increase\nin length of the particles (up to 1\u20133 lm). This effect is\nprobably associated with a decrease in the reduction\nrate of gold(III) species by dihydroxybenzenes or\nglucose compared to ascorbic acid. The reduction\npotential of the reducing agents strongly depends on\nthe pH value, and related effects on the dimensions of\nthe nanoparticles are also reflected in this study. The\nnanorods exhibited penta-twinned nature without\nnoteworthy defects (e.g. stacking faults and\ndislocations).",

  "experimental": "Recently, we reported a modified seed-mediated\ngrowth procedure, which was the basis for the\nsynthesis of gold nanorods and nanowires in this\nstudy (Koeppl et al. 2011). However, besides ascorbic\nacid, also hydroquinone, catechol, resorcinol or glucose\nwere applied as reducing agents in the growth\nsolution. Even though important experimental details\ndescribed in literature (Koeppl et al. 2011) should be\nconsidered, a short summary of a typical experiment is\ngiven in the following.\nIn a first step, 100 mLof a growth solution containing\n0.1 MCTAB and 2.5 9 10-4 MH[AuCl4] 3H2Owere\nprepared. This solution was kept at 33  C for 24 h to\ncompletely dissolve the CTAB powder. Further, 20 mL\nof a seed solution containing small gold particles was\nprepared. The formation of these gold particles is based\non the fast reduction of H[AuCl4] 3H2O by NaBH4 in\nthe presence of a stabilizing agent, here sodium citrate.\nThis solution was kept undisturbed for 24 h at room\ntemperature. During that time the seeds grew to*8 nm\ndiameter.\nAfter 24 h, 80 lL of a freshly prepared 0.1 M\nreducing agent solution (8.0 9 10-6 mol reducing\nagent) were added to 14.4 mL of the growth solution\n(containing 3.6 9 10-6 mol gold). The solution was\nmixed by shaking, whereupon it became colourless in\nthe case of ascorbic acid (indication for the reduction\nof AuIII to AuI) and brighter yellow in the case of\nhydroquinone. The colour of the solution did not\nchange for the other three used reducing agents. The\naddition of 16 lL of the seed solution (aged 24 h,\ncontaining 4.0 9 10-9 mol gold) and subsequent\nmixing of the solution by shaking led to a reddish\ncolour of the solution. In some experiments, sodium\nhydroxide solution (e.g. 80 lL, 0.1 M, leading to a\nfinal pH around 4) was used to modify the pH value,\nadded to the growth solution just before the addition of\nseed solution. In this case, after addition of the seed\nsolution the reaction mixture became transparent for\nall reducing agents after a certain time (if not already\ntransparent before addition of the seed solution). In\nparticular, for resorcinol and glucose the colour\nchange was observed only after hours. Finally the test\ntubes were placed in a water bath at 33  C for 24 h."

  "abstract": "Single-crystal gold nanospheres\nwith controlled diameters in\nthe range 5\u201330 nm were synthesized by\nusing a facile approach that was based\non successive seed-mediated growth.\nThe key to the success of this synthesis\nwas the use of hexadecyltrimethylammonium\nchloride (CTAC) as a capping\nagent and a large excess of ascorbic\nacid as a reductant to ensure fast reduction\nand, thus, single crystallinity\nand a spherical shape of the resultant\nnanoparticles. The diameters of the\ngold nanospheres could be readily controlled\nby varying the amount of seeds\nthat were introduced into the reaction\nsystem. The gold nanospheres could be\nproduced with uniform diameters of up\nto 30 nm; thus, their localized surface\nplasmon resonance properties could be\ndirectly compared with the results that\nwere obtained from theoretical calculations.\nInterestingly, we also found that\nthese gold nanospheres self-assembled\ninto dimers, larger aggregates, and\nwavy nanowires when they were collected\nby centrifugation, dispersed in\ndeionized water, and then diluted to\ndifferent volumes with deionized\nwater.",

This report details the first examples\nof higher-order penta-branched gold particles including rod-, wire-, and platelike\nparticles which contain a uniquely periodic starfruitlike morphology. These\nnanoparticles are synthesized in the presence of silver ions by a seed-mediated\napproach based on utilizing highly purified pentahedrally twinned gold nanorods and\nnanowires as seed particles. The extent of the growth can be varied, leading to shifts\nin the plasmon resonances of the particles. In addition, the application of the starfruit\nrods for surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is demonstrated.",

  "abstract": "Successful synthesis of gold nanorods requires\nsubtle combination of additives and reducing species. The\nlatter are of major importance, as the reducing power\ndetermines the rate of metallic gold formation, which often\ndefines the final shape and anisotropy. Ascorbic acid is a\ncommon reducing agent in the synthesis of gold nanorods, but\nits relatively strong reducing power limits the tunability of the\nfinal shape and optical response. We propose here a bimodal\nreducing agent system comprising a combination of salicylic\nacid and ascorbic acid. While salicylic acid prereduces Au(III)\nto Au(I) in the growth solution, ascorbic acid participates in\nthe autocatalytic reduction of Au(I) to Au(0), selectively\noccurring on the metallic surface. This combination provides a\nfine control over gold reduction at any stage of nanorod formation, which in turn leads to improved monodispersity, better\nreduction yield, and morphology control.",

Both PVP and the solvent environment play an important role for\nthe growth of nanowires. The growth mechanism has been properly discussed. We also report the\nflexible transparent Cu nanowire membrane electrode fabricated by coating a polymer layer as a\npotential replacement for the conventional FTO electrode in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).\nFabricated CuNW membranes exhibit high optical transmittance and electrical conductance, which\ncan be controlled via the synthesis process, conveniently. The efficiency of a DSSC with CuNWs\nincreases upto 5%. The DSSC performs as well as with a FTO electrode, which indicates that the\nsuper-high aspect ratio of the Cu nanowires offers a range of electrical transport routes to connect dye\nloaded photo-anodes, and such an electrode has the potential to replace conventional FTO electrodes\nfor low-cost DSSCs applications.",

To\nprepare feed precursor solutions for a typical synthesizing\nCuNWs, 0.5 mM CuCl2?2H2O (in ethanol solvent), and 0.5\nmM long-chain poly-vinylpyrrolidone (PVP, Mw = 60 000, in\nethanol solvent) were, simultaneously, injected dropwise into a\nround-bottom flask which was magnetically stirred at a rate of\n45 mL h21. Then the precursor solution was pre-heated for 3 min\nand flowed through a continuous flow reactor (CFR, Scheme 1)\nusing a low flow peristaltic pump at a total rate of 5.0 mL min21\nunder refluxing conditions at 80 uC, while hydrazine monohydrate\n(50% vol. in ethanol) was prepared in a separate flask with\nthe appropriate feed lines inserted, such that the final concentration\nof the precursor solution in the reaction column would be\npersisted unchanged. Here, PVP was used as a surface modified\nreagent and stabilized reagent to prevent the nanowires from\ncoalescing. Cu2+ ions were reduced to copper metal by the\nintroduction of an excess of hydrazine monohydrate under\nrefluxing conditions. The growth substrate (glass) is affixed on\nthe bottom of the inner cavity within the CFR before the\nreaction begins and their position along the interior column wall\ncan be controlled by rotation. As a result, much longer CuNWs\ndeposited on the glass substrate can be obtained. Further\nincreasing the reflux time over 4 h gave longer NWs."

  "experimental": "The electrochemical cell, fabricated in our laboratory using Perspex sheets, was washed in double distilled water. A copper rod of 0.3 cm diameter was used as a sacrificial electrode (anode). The cathode consists of copper foil attached to alumina disc by an adhesive tape of good conductivity. The electrolyte used had a composition of 20 gm/100ml CuSo4.5H2O + 25% of dilute H2So4 at room temperature. The inter-electode distance was kept 0.5 cm and a currant of 2mA was applied for 10 minutes. The anodisc was kept immensed in 1 M NaOH for 3 hours in a beaker to dissolve alumina template. The copper nanowires were liberated from the host matrix, washed in distilled water and dried in an oven at 500C for 30 minutes. The cleaned and dried nanowires were mounted on aluminium stubs with the help of double adhesive tape, sputtered with a layer of gold using Jeol sputter JFC 1100. Scanning electron microscope (Jeol, JSM 6100) was used to record cross-sectional and lateral views of grown nanowires at an accelerating voltage of 20kV using different magnifications. The images of copper nanowires were recorded on the photographic film in the form of negatives and developed in a dark room."

This\nmixture was swirled by hand for 5 seconds after each addition to mix the reactants. The solution\nwas then heated at 80 \u02daC and stirred at 200 rpm for approximately 3 minutes. After this heating\nstep, the solution was poured into a 50 ml centrifuge tube, and a solution of polyvinylpyrrolidone\n(PVP) in water (5 ml, 0.4 wt%) was gently added to the top of the reaction solution. The\ncentrifuge tube containing the reaction solution was placed in an ice bath for 1 hour. The\nCuNWs floated to the top of the reaction solution and were scooped into an aqueous wash\nsolution containing hydrazine (3 wt%) and PVP (1 wt%). The wash solution containing the\nCuNWs was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 minutes, and the supernate was decanted from the\nnanowires. The wires were then dispersed in new wash solution (containing 3 wt% hydrazine\nand 1 wt% PVP) by vortexing for 30 seconds, and then centrifuged and decanted for 3 more\ncycles. The CuNWs were stored in the hydrazine (3 wt%), PVP (1 wt%) solution at room\ntemperature to minimize oxidation."

When 10.5 mM N2H4 is present, the Cu\nNWs grow with a uniform thickness of 35 nm prior to 16 min\n(Fig. 1A). As the Cu NWs increase in length and yield, the\nsolution becomes homogeneously dark red. The Cu NWs then\nspontaneously float to the air\u2013water interface and start to turn\npink at approximately 19 minutes. At this intermediate stage the\nsurface of the nanowires becomes rough (Fig. 1B), presumably\ndue to the nucleation and growth of Cu particles on the surface of the nanowires. At B22 minutes, the Cu NWs form a pinkcoloured\ncake at the surface of the solution, and have an average\ndiameter of 154 nm (Fig. 1C). The thicker NWs appear smoother\nthan those at the intermediate stage. SEM images of nanowires at\neach stage of this process are given in Fig. S1 (ESI\u2020). Fig. 1D shows\nthat approximately 40% of the Cu(II) precursor is converted into thin\nnanowires at 16 min, and the remainder of the copper precursor\nadds to the sides of the nanowires over the next 6minutes, resulting\nin a dramatic decrease in the nanowire aspect ratio."

  "abstract": "Ultra-long and uniform copper nanowires with controllable diameters of 30\u2013100 nm, length up to several millimeters (aspect ratio >105) and tunable crystallinity were obtained by hydrothermal processing the complex emulsion of copper (II) chloride and ODA at 120\u2013180 \u00b0C. Both XRD pattern and EDX spectrum indicated that the products were pure copper without any observable impurities. It is observed by FESEM that the diameters and aspect ratios of the synthesized copper nanowires were influenced by the concentration of ODA and reaction temperature. HRTEM images and SAED patterns revealed that the crystallinity of copper nanowires were strongly dependent on the synthesis temperatures. Poly- and single-crystal copper nanowires were obtained at 120 \u00b0C and 180 \u00b0C, respectively.",

In a typical synthesis of copper nanoparticles, 50 ml aqueous solution of 0.4 M L-ascorbic acid (reagent grade, \ufb01ne crystal, Fisher Scienti\ufb01c) and 0.8 M Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) (in repeating unit, weight-average molecular weight of 58,000, Acros Organics) was directly mixed with another 50 ml aqueous solution of 0.01 M copper(II) nitride (anhydrous, 99%, Acros Organics) and 0.8 M PVP under stirring. Then the mixture was kept in constant 45 C without any inert gas protection. After about 1 h, the initial precursor solution with light blue color changed to red colloidal slurry, indicating the formation of Cu nanoparticles. After 3 h there was no further color change and red Cu nanoparticles were collected via centrifuge (8000 rpm for 30 min) of the colloid. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images were obtained using Philips CM12 with 100 kV accelerating voltage. A Jeol 2010F with accelerating voltage of 200 kV was used for HRTEM image. Samples for the TEM imaging were prepared by placing a drop of the colloidal solution on a copper grid (400 meshes, Ted Pella Inc.) coated with formvar. X-ray di\ufb00raction patterns of the copper nanoparticles were recorded by using a Rigaku D/Max-B X-ray di\ufb00ractometer (nickel \ufb01ltered Cu K a radiation (k=1.54056 Angstrom) under 35 kV and 30 mA) with the powder sample dried on a microscope slide in a slurry form.

  "experimental": "I. Chemicals. CuCl2\u00b72H2O (AR), glucose (AR), and OM (OM, 80\u221290%) were purchased from Aladdin. OA (90%) was obtained from Aldrich. PVP, MW = 55000, was purchased from Alfa. All chemicals were used as received without further puri\ufb01cation. II. Large-Scale Synthesis of Di\ufb00erent Lengths of Copper Nanowires. CuCl2\u00b72H2O (6.8 g, \u223c40 mmol) and glucose (7.92 g, \u223c40 mmol) were added to a 900 mL beaker containing 800 mL of H2O under magnetic sirring. Then, 80 mL of OM, 0.8 mL of OA, and 140 mL of ethanol were loaded to a 400 mL beaker under magnetic stirring. Afterward, these two solutions were put into a 5 L plastic container and diluted to 4000 mL with water, followed by magnetic stirring for 12 h on a 50 \u00b0C hot plate. The color of the mixture changed from blue to caesious (see Supporting Information, Figure S1). Subsequently, the mixture was transferred to a 5 L electric\npressure cooker. The reaction temperature was held for 2\u221212 h. Finally, the reddish brown CuNWs were obtained. III. Preparation of Transparent and Conductive CuNW Films. After the reaction, 4 mL of the crude solution of CuNWs was centrifuged for 4 min at 12000 rpm, then the precipitate was sonicated and centrifuged twice in an ethanol solution containing 2.0 wt % PVP. Afterward, CuNWs were centrifuged twice again in ethanol solution to remove the free PVP and were redispersed in ethanol for SEM, TEM, UV\u2212vis, and XRD measurements. CuNW \ufb01lms were prepared by spin coating. The ethanol solution of PVP-capped CuNWs was sonicated for 5 min and spun on a glass substrate at 2500 rpm for 10 s. Subsequently, the \ufb01lms were sintered in a nitrogen-\ufb01lled glovebox at 340 \u00b0C for 20 min to remove the resident PVP from the surface. Finally, the CuNW \ufb01lms were cooled to room temperature in the glovebox to avoid oxidation. IV. Characterizations. The powder XRD pattern was measured using a Bruker D8 FOCUS X-ray di\ufb00ractometer. UV\u2212vis transmittance spectra were measured using a Shimadzu UV-3600. The SEM images were characterized on a Hitachi-4800 \ufb01eld-emission SEM. TEM images were taken on a FEI Tecnai G2 F20 with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The sheet resistances of CuNW \ufb01lms were measured by a Hall e\ufb00ect system (ET9000, East Changing Technologies, Inc.)."

  "abstract": "This paper demonstrates that Cu 2 O nanoparticles form in the early stages of a solution-phase synthesis of copper nanowires, and aggregate to form the seeds from which copper nanowires grow. Removal of ethylenediamine from the synthesis leads to the rapid formation of Cu 2O  octahedra. These octahedra are introduced as seeds in the same copper nanowire synthesis to improve the yield of copper nanowires from 12% to >55%, and to enable independent control over the length of the nanowires. Transparent conducting \ufb01 lms are made from nanowires with different lengths to examine the effect of nanowire aspect ratio on the \ufb01 lm performance.",

N 2 H 4  (Sigma-Aldrich, 35 wt%, 25 \u00b5L) was quickly injected into the above solution after stirring for 5 min. Upon addition of N 2 H 4 , the mixture initially turned white and cloudy, and changed to a clear and colorless solution within the \ufb01 rst 2 min. The solution remained clear till t = \u223c60 min when a dark red color slowly appeared throughout the entire solution. An aqueous solution (\u223c15 mL) containing 3% PVP (polyvinylpyrrolidone, Sigma-Aldrich, MW = 10 K) and 1% DEHA (diethylhydroxylamine, Acros Organics) was added to the growth solution to collect the nanowires. The mixture was then transferred to a separation funnel and vigorously shaken until a white clump of PVP and nanowires \ufb02 oated to the surface. The bottom solution was drained and fresh PVP/DEHA solution was added to re-disperse the nanowires. Cu NWs were then puri\ufb01 ed with 1% DEHA solution for further characterization by three cycles of centrifugation (10 min at 2000 rpm) and decantation. The typical SEM (FEI XL30 SEM-FEG) samples were prepared by drying the puri\ufb01 ed nanowire solution on a silicon wafer under nitrogen \ufb02 ow. The puri\ufb01 ed nanowire solution was also dried on a Cu grid for TEM (FEI Tecnai G 2  Twin) and on a glass slide for XRD (Panalytical X\u2019Pert PRO MRD) under nitrogen. During the course of the reaction, small aliquots of the reaction solution were drawn and imaged with a dark \ufb01 eld optical microscope (Olympus BX51 \ufb01 tted with a SC30 CMOS camera). The SEM samples in Figure 1   were prepared by dipping a small piece of plasma cleaned silicon wafer into the reaction solution at a given time point for 15 seconds.

  "experimental": "Ethylene glycol (EG) was used as the solvent because of its relatively high boiling point (about 196\u25e6C). Although the compound could serve as a reducer in many other cases, it could not be used as a reducing agent in the case of Cu (II). Ascorbic acid was used as a reducer instead, and the copper nanocubes were produced via the solution-phase reduction method using PVP as the capping agent. In a typical procedure, solutions of PVP (0.30 M, 5 ml, Mw \u2248 40000, Fluka) in anhydrous ethylene glycol (EG), CuSO4 (0.10 M, 3 ml) in EG and ascorbic acid (0.25 M, 3 ml) were prepared. The PVP solution was stirred with a magnetic bar and heatedto 140\u25e6C in a three-neckedround bottom \ufb02ask. Then the room temperature solutions of CuSO4 and ascorbic acidweresimultaneouslyinjected,drop-wise,intothehotPVP solutionatarateofapproximately0.25ml min\u22121 byasyringe. Immediately after the \ufb01rst injection of CuSO4 and ascorbic acid solutions, the reaction mixture turned red, indicating the formationof copperseeds. When more of thesesolutionswere added, the reaction system gradually became turbid with a darker red wine colour. Heating and stirring were maintained forafurtherhourandthesolution\ufb01nallyturnedreddishbrown, it was then cooled to 80\u25e6C and aged for approximately one hour in order to promote the growth of nanoparticles. It was necessary to add a further small amount of the ascorbic acid solutionintothereactionmixtureduringthisprocesstoprevent the Cu nanocubes being oxidized. When the reaction \ufb01nished, the reaction system was cooled to room temperature, then diluted with ethanol and centrifuged (2000 rpm, 15 min). The supernatant was rejected in order to remove the by-products, excess PVP and unconverted salts. This process was repeated at least six times. The \ufb01nal products were collected and dispersed in ethanol at room temperature (\ufb01gure 1(A)). The morphology of the Cu nanoparticles was observed in detail using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM). The samples for SEM measurements were prepared on Si(100) wafer. The SEM images were taken on a \ufb01eld emission SEM (Hitachi S4300, 15 kV). The TEM images and corresponding selectedarea electron diffraction (SAED) patterns were recorded on a JEOL TEM-2010 electron microscope (Japan) performed at 200 kV. The absorption spectrum was investigated on a JASCO UV-530 UV\u2013vis spectrophotometer in the wavelength range of 350\u2013800 nm. The x-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patternswere investigatedwith a scanning rate of 0.02\u25e6 s\u22121 on a Rigaku (Japan) D/max-\u03b3A x-ray diffraction meter equipped with Cu K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb = 1.5418 \u02daA). The samples for XRDinvestigationwerepreparedbycastingthesolutionofthe products on glass substrates. After evaporation of the solvent, the samples could thenbe subjectedto the XRD measurement."

  "abstract": "Palladium octahedra, truncated octahedra, cuboctahedra, truncated cubes, and nanocubes with sizes of tens of nanometers have been synthesized in an aqueous mixture of H2PdCl4 solution, cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) surfactant, KBr solution, dilute KI solution, and ascorbic acid solution at 35 \u00b0C for 30 min. By tuning the amount of dilute KBr solution introduced, particle shape control can be achieved. Adjusting the volumes of the Pd precursor and KBr solutions added, smaller and larger Pd nanocrystals were obtained with excellent shape control. Extensive structural and optical characterization of these nanocrystals has been performed. Two absorption bands in the ultraviolet region can be discerned for these Pd nanocrystals. Concave Pd cubes can also be prepared. Pd cubes were found to grow at a faster rate than that for the formation of octahedra. The concentrations of KBr and KI in the solution are so low that spectral shifts were not detected upon their addition to the solution. The Pd nanocrystals can readily be used for various applications after simple removal of surfactant.",

A 10 mM H2PdCl4 solution was prepared by completely dissolving 0.0178 g of PdCl2 powder in 10 mL of 20 mM HCl solution.\nSynthesis of Palladium Nanocrystals\nFor the growth of Pd octahedra, truncated octahedra, cuboctahedra, truncated cubes, and cubes, 9.175, 9.150, 9.145, 9.135, and 9.125 mL of deionized water were respectively introduced into sample vials. Subsequently, 0.048 g of CTAC and 0.7 mL of 10 mM H2PdCl4 solution were added to each of the sample vials. The vials were kept in a water bath set at 35 \u00b0C throughout the particle synthesis. Then 0, 25, 30, 40, and 50 \u03bcL of 1.0 \u00d7 10\u20133 M KBr solution were introduced to make Pd octahedra, truncated octahedra, cuboctahedra, truncated cubes, and cubes, respectively. The vials were left undisturbed in the water bath for 15 min for halide ligand replacement reaction to complete.(1) Next, 5 \u03bcL of 1.0 \u00d7 10\u20133 M KI solution was introduced, and the solution was left undisturbed for another 15 min. Finally, 120 \u03bcL of 0.05 M AA was added with thorough mixing, and the mixture was kept in the water bath for another 30 min to form Pd nanocrystals. The solution color turned light brown quickly within 30 s of introduction of AA and became dark brown in 30 min. Finally, the particles were collected by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 10 min. The precipitate was centrifuged one more time with 10 mL deionized water at 4000 rpm for 10 min to remove the surfactant. Experimental conditions for the formation of Pd nanocrystals with smaller and larger sizes are given in the Supporting Information."

  "abstract": "In synthesis in a solution phase, adsorbates such as halides can interact selectively with different metal crystal facets and affect the final morphology of nanocrystals. Pseudo-halide thiocyanate ions (SCN\u2212) can also adsorb on the metal surface, but they have never been used for the synthesis of shape-controlled colloidal metal nanocrystals. In this study, we first investigated the effect of SCN\u2212 on the morphology of palladium nanocrystals through a seed-mediated growth method. The presence of 1 \u00b5M SCN\u2212 in the growth solutions could lead to the formation of palladium polyhedra: truncated rhombic dodecahedra enclosed by twelve {110}, eight {111} and six {100} facets. The products were nanocubes enclosed with six {100} facets if cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) was the only capping agent. Meanwhile, the mechanism of the effect of SCN\u2212 on the morphology of Pd nanocrystals is discussed.",

  "experimental": "The method of producing Pd seeds is similar to our previous reports.20 Briefly, 0.5 mL aliquot of 10 mM H2PdCl4 solution was added to 9420 \u00b5L of 12.5 mM CTAB solution heated at 95 \u00b0C under stirring. After 5 minutes, 80 \u00b5L of freshly prepared 100 mM ascorbic acid solution was added, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 20 min. The nanocube solution was stored at 30 \u00b0C for future use as seeds. Palladium seeds were collected by centrifugation (12000 rpm, 10 min) and washed by redispersing in doubly distilled water and centrifuging twice for scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterization.\n\nIn a typical synthesis, 5 \u00b5L of 1 mM KSCN solution was added to 5 mL of 100 mM CTAB solution kept at a given temperature. 250 \u00b5L of 10 mM H2PdCl4 solution and 80 \u00b5L as-synthesized seed palladium nanocube solution were then added. Finally, 50 \u00b5L of freshly prepared 100 mM ascorbic acid solution was added and the solution was mixed thoroughly. The resulting solution was placed in a water bath at 40 \u00b0C, 60 \u00b0C and 80 \u00b0C, respectively. Reactions at the same temperature were set up in parallel. When the orange solutions became colorless, the reactions were complete. The reaction time were about 15 h, 2 h and 1 h for 40 \u00b0C, 60 \u00b0C and 80 \u00b0C, respectively. The precipitates were collected by centrifugation (6000 rpm, 5 min) and washed by redispersing in doubly distilled water and centrifuging twice for SEM, TEM and selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) characterization."

Solutions of desired concentrations of the precursor and reducing agent were prepared in water. In order to stabilize the Pd nanoparticles, approximately 1.0 mM CTAB was added in solutions [46]. Initially, both aqueous solutions were introduced through a Y-shaped junction to the continuous flow microreactor using two syringes, which were operated by peristaltic pumps at a controlled flow rate. A simple copper capillary microreactor was fabricated in house (0.8 mm inner diameter and 124 cm length of the tube).The molar ratio of precursor to reducing agent was maintained at 1:4 and 1:8. If the ratio of precursor to reducing agent is less than 1:4, there is possibility of oxidation of the metal particles. The flow rate of precursor and reducing agent was maintained at 30 and 50 mL/h for two different experimental runs. The microreactor was immersed in a temperature-controlled water bath to maintain the temperature at 25 \u00b0C. Finally, Pd colloidal suspension was formed in dark brown in color. The suspension was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 20 min, washed with water and acetone 3\u20134 times to remove unwanted impurities and salts from product and then dried (at a constant temperature of 100 \u00b0C) under vacuum to recover Pd nanoparticles."

The electroactive part of the sonoelectrode was the planar circular surface (area 0.28 cm2) at the bottom of the horn. The immersed cylindrical part was isolated by a plastic jacket. This sonoelectrode produced a sonic pulse that followed immediately a current pulse.  The  course  could  be  demonstrated  as  Fig.  1. A pulse drive was used to control a potentiostat (devised by  the  Applied  Physics  Institution  of  Nanjing  University). At the end of the reaction, the precipitate was centrifuged, washed with distilled water for three times, and\ndried in air. The phase purity of the products was characterized  by  a  Philips  X\u2019pert  (Eindhoven,  The  Netherlands) x-ray diffractometer. The  morphology  of  as-prepared  products  was  ob-\nserved  by  a  JEOL-JEM  200CX  transmission  electron microscope  (accelerating  voltage:  200  kV)  and  JEM-4000EX  high-resolution  transmission  electron  microscope (accelerating voltage: 400 kV) (Japan)."

The resulting aqueous colloids are stable over extended periods of time and can be prepared at high nanoparticle loading (20 g/L of Pd) with no agglomeration. The size of the nanoparticles can be reduced from the nanometer (ca. 3.5 nm) to the sub-nanometer size range (ca. 0.9 nm). Detailed magnetic characterization indicated that the larger, 3.5 nm nanoparticles show ferromagnetic properties at room temperature, while the sub-nanometric ones lose this magnetic behavior.",

The method is a variation of those proposed by the Brust and Caruso groups.27,28 In a typical synthesis, 15 mL of a 30 mM aqueous solution of Na2PdCl4 was mixed with 40 mL of a 50 mM TOAB solution in toluene. Two hours later the transfer of the [PdCl4]2\u2212 from the aqueous solution to the organic phase was completed as revealed by the red-brown color of the organic phase due to the [PdCl4]2\u2212/TOAB complex. The colourless water phase was disposed and the toluene phase dried with Na2SO4. Then, 11.4 mL of a freshly prepared 0.1 M NaBH4 aqueous solution was slowly added, keeping the mixture under vigorous stirring. The mixture was gently stirred overnight and, after removing the water phase, the organic phase was washed with 40 mL of a 0.1 M H2SO4 solution, 40 mL of a 0.1 M NaOH solution, and finally three times with 40 mL of dionized water. To remove the remaining water, the organosol was finally dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. Palladium nanoparticle samples were obtained by mixing 40 mL of the organosol with 1 L of ethanol and kept for 24 h at \u221218 \u00b0C. The fine black precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 12000 rpm and washed with ethanol.\n\nWith the aim of obtaining a homogeneous size distribution, especially with an average size in the nanometer range, the experimental conditions were systematically varied by altering some experimental parameters: i) capping agent concentration from 25 mM to 100 mM TOAB solution; ii) reducing agent concentration from 0.1 M to 1.2 M NaBH4 solution; iii) water content in the [PdCl4]2\u2212toluene solution from 0 and 500 \u00b5L; iv) stirring rate from 400 to 1600 rpm.\n\nParticle sizes in the range between 0.9 and 3.5 nm were obtained by systematically varying the above parameters.\n\nThis step was carried out following the procedure developed by Gittins and Caruso.28 An aqueous 0.1 M DMAP solution was added to the as-prepared Pd nanoparticles in toluene, and the mixture was stirred for two hours. The conditions to perform the complete transfer of the Pd nanoparticles into the aqueous phase were studied. In a typical transfer reaction, 10 mL of the aqueous 0.1 M DMAP solution was mixed with 40 mL of the Pd nanoparticles colloid in toluene. To obtain a highly concentrated Pd hydrosol, the amount of DMAP solution was decreased to 2.5 mL."

  "abstract": "A novel method for isolation of monodispersed Pd nanoparticles from a reverse microemulsion was developed using hydrocarbon evaporation and methanol-assisted particle purification from a surfactant. Fcc Pd nanoparticles of 6, 8, 11, and 13 nm in diameter were isolated from water/AOT/isooctane mixture and used to study a size effect during solvent-free hydrogenation of 2-methyl-3-butyn-2-ol to 2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol. The initial TOF calculated per mole of surface palladium atoms was duplicated when particle size was increased from 6 to 13 nm but remained constant when accounted per number of specific Pd atoms on Pd(111) facets. Selectivity to olefinic alcohol was not size-dependent, but an increase in particle size decreased the byproduct ratio of dimers to saturated alcohol. Acetylenic alcohol hydrogenation is shown to be a structure-sensitive but size-independent reaction for Pd particles with size of 6\u201313 nm. The work shows also that the Pd size controlled the reaction rate and the byproduct distribution.",

Pd nanoparticles were synthesized in reverse ME of water/AOT/isooctane at different water-to-surfactant ratios (3, 4, 5, and 7) as described previously [49]. The aqueous solution of PdCl2(NH3)4 (0.05 M) was used as a metal precursor (pH 9, adjusted with ammonia), and the solution of hydrazine hydrate (3 M) as a reducing agent, giving a hydrazine-to-Pd molar ratio of 60 to ensure precursor reduction. The reverse ME containing metal precursor or reducing agent was prepared by injecting the required amounts of the corresponding aqueous solution into an isooctane solution of AOT (0.35 M) and then mixing for a few minutes for the preparation of Pd nanoparticles. As an example, for the preparation of nanoparticle-containing MEs with a water-to-surfactant ratio of 7, 15.45 g AOT, total isooctane volume of 0.1 L, 2.2 mL of aqueous Pd precursor, and 2.2 mL of reductant were used.\n\nAfter 1 h of reduction at room temperature, isooctane was evaporated in a rotary evaporator at 323 K, and the nanoparticles were purified from an excess of surfactant by addition of methanol followed by centrifugation (). Precipitated Pd nanoparticles after centrifugation were immediately redispersed under ultrasound in the substrate (MBY) for the hydrogenation reaction and used in catalytic runs. Pd colloids remained stable for at least 1 month without any special precautions."

  "abstract": "Palladium nanoparticles of average size around 8 nm have been synthesized rapidly by UV irradiation of mixture of palladium chloride and potassium oxalate solutions. A rod-shaped palladium oxalate complex has been observed as an intermediate. In the absence of potassium oxalate, no Pd nanoparticles have been observed. The synthesized Pd nanoparticles have been characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), selective area electron diffraction and energy dispersive analysis by X-rays (EDAX) analyses. XRD analysis indicates the preferential orientation of catalytically active {111} planes in Pd nanoparticles. A plausible mechanism has been proposed for the formation of anisotropic Pd nanoparticles.",

Formation of reddish yellow needles was observed. But, upon further dilution, the needles disappeared. Nitrogen gas was purged through reaction mixture for 5 min. Then, the mixture in a quartz tube was irradiated using 450 W Hg lamp (Oriel Corporation, USA) for 5 min in order to get the black precipitate. No cut-off filters have been used. Upon irradiation, orange coloured solution turned to colourless and particles formed settled down due to the self-assembly caused by oxalate di anion. The black particles were washed with distilled water by centrifugation at 6000 rpm."

They were compared with those produced by a conventional heating method. We also used various alcohol solvents and compared the products obtained. The products contained particles that had diameters of several nanometers. In these measurements, microwave heating produced smaller particles than conventional heating because it provided homogeneous and direct heating. Additionally, Pd/spherical carbon (SC) composite particles could be prepared by the same method. For microwave heating, SC particles can support palladium particles without calcination, which is due to selective heating by microwaves.",

The generated nanoparticles were characterized with UV\u2013visible spectroscopy (UV\u2013vis), dynamic light scattering (DLS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. The formation of palladium nanoparticles was confirmed from the appearance of intense brown colour and broad continuous absorption spectra in the UV\u2013visible region. The produced nanoparticles were found to be spherical in shape, polydisperse and the average particle size was 4.8 \u00b1 1.6 nm. The face centred cubic crystal structure of the fabricated nanoparticles is confirmed from the selected-area electron diffraction and XRD patterns. Compared to earlier reports, the nanoparticles showed superior antioxidant at a much lower nanoparticle dose. Also, the homogenous catalytic activity of palladium nanoparticles was studied by probing the reduction of dyes such as coomassie brilliant blue G-250, methylene blue, methyl orange, and a nitro compound, 4-nitrophenol with sodium borohydride. The nanoparticles exhibited excellent catalytic activity in dye degradation and the results of this study demonstrate the possible application of biogenic palladium nanoparticles as nanocatalyst in environmental remediation.",

All the solutions were prepared in ultra pure water. \u201cGum ghatti\u201d, grade-1 was purchased from Girijan Co-operative Corporation Ltd., Hyderabad, India. The gum was powdered in a Prestige Deluxe-Vs high speed mechanical blender (Bengaluru, India) and sieved to obtain a particle size of 38 \u03bcm. Then, a 0.5% (w/v) of homogenous gum stock solution was prepared in ultrapure water by stirring overnight at room temperature. Then, this solution was centrifuged (5500\u00d7g, 10 min) to remove the insoluble materials and the supernatant was used for synthesis. The palladium nanoparticles were synthesized by autoclaving the gum solutions containing PdCl2 at 121 \u00b0C and 103 kPa for 30 min. The effect of variations of concentrations of gum (0.1\u20130.5%) and palladium chloride (0.125\u20131.0 mM) on nanoparticle synthesis was also studied."

  "abstract": "This paper describes a simple and versatile method for growing highly anisotropic nanostructures of Pd, single-crystal nanobars bounded by {100} facets and single-crystal nanorods with their side surfaces enclosed by {100} and {110} facets. According to thermodynamic arguments, Pd atoms should nucleate and grow in a solution phase to form cuboctahedrons of spherical shape with their surfaces bounded by a mix of {111} and {100} facets. Anisotropic nanostructures can only form under kinetically controlled conditions, while the cubic symmetry is broken. In the present system, we found that one-dimensional growth could be induced and maintained through an interplay of the following processes:\u2009 (i) speedy reduction of the precursor to ensure prompt addition of atoms to the seed; (ii) chemisorption of bromide on the seed to promote the formation of {100} and {110} facets; and (iii) localized oxidative etching on one specific face of the seed to initiate preferential growth on this face. Experimentally, the anisotropic growth can be achieved by varying the type and concentration of reducing agent, as well as by adjusting the reaction temperature. This methodology developed for Pd has also been extended to both Au and Pt. As expected for a kinetically controlled product, the anisotropic nanostructure evolved into the thermodynamically favored shape during an aging process.",

  "abstract": "In this study, we have used a simple seed-mediated synthesis process to prepare uniform Pd nanorods with average lengths of \u223c200 and 300 nm through the addition of 50\u2212100 \u03bcL of 0.004 M copper acetate solution into the growth solution for the first time. Because of their long lengths, they nicely settled to the bottom of the reaction vial and can easily be separated from the suspended faceted particles. The nanorods have an average diameter of \u223c20 nm, so they have high aspect ratios of 10\u221215 or more. They can readily self-assemble into high-density packing structures on substrates. By increasing the volume of the copper acetate solution added to 250 \u03bcL, extensively branched Pd nanocrystals were obtained. The crystal structures of both particle morphologies have been examined. The nanorods possess a penta-twinned structure. Different growth directions have been found for the branched nanocrystals. The growth mechanism of these nanostructures was studied in great detail. A mixture of short Pd rods and faceted particles was formed first and elongated into long rods or branched nanocrystals with the assistance of copper atom deposition. A reduction potential of copper lower than that of palladium leads to periodic deposition and reoxidation of copper atoms on the growing rods and faceted particles. Use of other metal ions did not form long nanorods and branched nanocrystals. UV\u2212vis spectra of the 200 nm Pd nanorods showed a significant absorption band in the near-infrared region with band maximum at \u223c1800 nm, while the 300 nm rods have band maxima of 2000\u22122100 nm. Both the nanorods and branched nanocrystals were found to serve as highly efficient and recyclable catalysts for catalyzing a Suzuki coupling reaction between phenylboronic acid and iodobenzene. They are also thermally stable under the reflux condition and can be easily removed from the product solution. These novel Pd nanostructures should find use in other palladium-catalyzed reactions.",

The growth solution was prepared by adding 0.345 g of CTAB powder and 10 mL of 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22124 M PdCl42\u2212 solution into both of these vials and stirred until the CTAB powder was completely dissolved. The solution gives a pale orange color. Then 78 \u03bcL of 0.1 M l-(+)-ascorbic acid (Riedel-de-Ha\u00ebn, 99.7%) was added as a reducing agent into vial A. Next, 84 \u03bcL of the seed solution was transferred into vial A, and the vial was shaken for 5 s. After 2 h, the solution in vial A turned blackish green. At this time, 100 \u03bcL of 4.0 \u00d7 10\u22123 M copper(II) acetate (J.T. Baker, 98%) solution was added to vial B, followed by the addition of 78 \u03bcL of 0.1 M l-(+)-ascorbic acid. A volume of 84 \u03bcL of the blackish green solution in vial A was withdrawn and added to vial B. Again, this vial was shaken for 5 s. The mixture was left undisturbed at 30 \u00b0C for 20 h, and the solution turned dark brown. After decanting the solution which contains mostly spherical or faceted Pd nanoparticles, a black precipitate was observed at the bottom of the vial. The black precipitate was found to be Pd nanorods with an average length of 308 nm. To collect the product, 6 mL of deionized water was added to the precipitate and the solution was subject to centrifugation at 6500 rpm for 16 min (Hermle Z323 centrifuge). The top solution was withdrawn with a pipet. To ensure the removal of the surfactant, the precipitate was redispersed in 6 mL of deionized water and centrifuged at 6800 rpm for 16 min. A simple illustration of the procedure used here is shown in Scheme 1."

  "abstract": "A simple method for the controlled growth of single crystalline palladium nanorods is presented. Through tuning the molar ratio of two surfactants, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP), single crystalline palladium nanorods with different aspect ratios can be synthesized in large quantities. The introduction of cosurfactant CTAB is critical to the growth of palladium nanorods. Its headgroup CTA+ and counterion Br\u2212 anion act as stabilizing species and etchant, respectively. Compared with PVP-capped Pd nanoparticles, the Pd nanorods show a ferromagnetism behavior at 5 and 300 K, respectively.",

  "experimental": "In our approach, palladium salts were reduced by the popular polyol method.(25) EG was used as both solvent and reductant, whereas PVP acted as surfactant. The growth of palladium rods could be achieved by introducing a cosurfactant, CTAB. In a typical synthesis, a solution of 0.6 mmol PVP was mixed with 10 mL of EG in a three-neck flask and heated at 150 \u00b0C for 1 h under argon flow. Ten minutes after the injection of 2 mL aqueous CTAB solution (0.09 M) into the flask, 1 mL of aqueous H2PdCl4 (0.125 M) solution was added in the solution with vigorous stirring. The solution was then kept at 150 \u00b0C for 30 min and cooled to room temperature. The product was precipitated by acetone and washed with ethanol four times to remove excess EG and surfactants. The final black product could be easily redispersed in polar solvents such as ethanol and water to yield a clear homogeneous solution."

  "abstract": "For the first time, we report green chemistry approach using vitamin B2 in the synthesis of silver (Ag) and palladium (Pd), nanospheres, nanowires, and nanorods at room temperature without using any harmful reducing agents, such as sodium borohydride (NaBH4) or hydroxylamine hydrochloride and any special capping or dispersing agent. Vitamin B2 was used as reducing agent as well as capping agent due to its high-water solubility, biodegradability, and low-toxicity compared with other reducing agents. The average particle size of nanoprticle was found to be Ag (average size 6.1 \u00b1 0.1\u2009nm) and Pd (average size 4.1 \u00b1 0.1\u2009nm) nanoparticles in ethylene glycol and Ag (average size 5.9 \u00b1 0.1\u2009nm, and average size 6.1 \u00b1 0.1) nanoparticles in acetic acid and NMP, respectively. The formation of noble multiple shape nanostructures and their self assembly were dependent on the solvent employed for the preparation. When water was used as solvent media, Ag and Pd nanoparticles started to self-assemble into rod-like structures and in isopropanol Ag and Pd nanoparticles yielded wire-like structures with a thickness in the range of 10 to 20\u2009nm and several hundred microns in length. In acetone and acetonitrile medium, the Ag and Pd nanoparticles are self-assembled into a regular pattern making nanorod structures with thicknesses ranging from 100 to 200\u2009nm and lengths of a few microns. The so-synthesized nanostructures were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis, and UV spectroscopy. The ensuing Ag and Pd nanoparticles catalyzed the reactions of aniline and pyrrole to generate polyaniline and polypyrrole nanofibers and may find various technological and biological applications. This single-step greener approach is general and can be extended to other noble metals and transition metal oxides.",

In all experiments, Milli-Q water was used. The synthesis and self-assembly were accomplished by reacting respective metal salts with vitamin B2 dissolved in solvents of different chemical nature. The reaction mixture was allowed to stand for 24 hours at room temperature and then analyzed. In particularly, 50\u2009mg of Riboflavin was dissolved in 20\u2009mL (glass vial) of solvents such as ethylene glycol, acetic acid, N-methylpyrrolidinone (NMP), water, isopropanol, acetone, and acetonitrile in separate experiments. To this, 2\u2009mL of aqueous solution containing 1x10-1\u2009M AgNO3 were added at room temperature, hand-shaken for a minute and allowed to settle. The solution turned orange immediately after the addition of AgNO3 and the formation of silver nanoparticles was confirmed using UV spectroscopy and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX). Similarly, experiments were conducted using 1x10-1\u2009M PdCl2. TEM specimens were prepared by placing 1\u2009 L of the particle solution on a carbon-coated copper grid and dried at room temperature. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed with a JEOL-1200 EX II microscope operated at 120\u2009kV."

TEM analysis demonstrated the formation of decahedron shape PdNPs with a diameter of 55\u201360 nm and XRD confirmed its crystalline nature. It showed photocatalytic decomposition of MB (>72%, k = 0.002164 min\u22121, 10 mg/L) in an aqueous solution under solar light irradiation. From the results obtained it is suggested that ultrasound agitated aqueous leaf extract demonstrates a simple, rapid, inexpensive method and should be utilized in future as green technology for the fabrication of nanoparticles.",

Fresh Andean blackberry leaves (BL) were collected from the open market near Universidad de las Fuerzas Armadas ESPE, Sangolqui, Ecuador. The collected fresh BL (5 g) was washed thoroughly with Milli-Q water; heated (65\u201370 \u00b0C) in 50 mL of Milli-Q water for 60 min. After cooling, yellowish-green color extract was filtered using Whatman paper No. 1. The filtrate was collected in a 50 mL Erlenmeyer flask and stored at 4 \u00b0C for further use. For green synthesis, 1.0 mL of BL extract was mixed with 10 mL of 1 mM K2PdCl6 solution; (a) kept at 25 \u00b0C for 24 h and then (b) agitated under sonication. Ultrasound irradiation was carried out with ultrasonic processors (DAIGGER GE 505, 500 W, 20 kHz) immersed directly into the reaction solution. The operating condition was at 30 s pulse on and 30 s pulse off time with amplitude of 72% at 25 \u00b0C for 30 (10 \u00d7 3) min. After ultrasound irradiation, reduction of Pd2+ to Pd was observed by the change in their color (yellow to brownish-black) of the reaction mixture.

After dispersion into pure water and casting on the surface of glassy carbon (GC), Pd nanocubes were found to assemble to form a two-dimensional square array, presumably due to the effect of CTAB. In addition, simply allowing the Pd nanocubes to lie in solution on the smooth GC surface lead to the formation of a flat and continuous structure of assembled Pd nanocubes on the GC surface.",

Into 18 ml of 0.1 M CTAB aqueous solution, 0.5 ml of 0.01 M K2PdCl6, prepared by dissolving into hot pure water, was added with stirring at 25 \u00b0C. During this process, the color of the solution changed from colorless to light brown. Then, 0.1 ml of 0.1 M ascorbic acid was added, followed by the addition of 0.12 ml of 0.1 M NaOH. The solution was just shaken to mix it, and then left for 24 h without stirring. The color of the solution gradually changed from the light brown to brown black. After 24 h, we centrifuged the solution at 3500 rpm for 15 min to obtain black precipitate. The precipitate was washed with pure water several times by repeated sonication and centrifugation. The precipitate was then redispersed into pure water by sonication for 10 min, and the suspension was dropped on the cleaned GC and dried at air for characterization. As an alternative preparation method, a piece of GC plate was immersed into the solution to allow the Pd nanocubes to lie on the surface. The GC plate was taken out and flushed gently with water to wash it."

Further, the superior electrocatalytic performance of the present anisotropic cubic chain-like Pd nanostructures toward the oxidation of alcohols makes them excellent candidates as high performance multipurpose catalysts for direct formic acid fuel cells (DFAFC), direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC), direct ethanol fuel cells (DEFC), respectively.",

The modified polyol method with the gradual addition of Pd and polyvinylpyrollidone precursors in EG at 160\u00b0C has led to control their size and morphology in the 10\u2009nm range using 0.02\u2009M AgNO3.

Various sizes and shapes of Pd NPs are observed by alcohol reduction. The results show the size and morphology control of Pd NPs with chemical reductions of Pd salts by ethanol and ethylene glycol (EG) that have very different reduction processes. The modified polyol method with the gradual addition of Pd and polyvinylpyrollidone precursors in EG at 160\u00b0C has led to control their size and morphology in the 10\u2009nm range using 0.02\u2009M AgNO3. It is observed that the Pd nanorod is also formed. The main factors that will control the shapes of Pd NPs have been presented to explain their growth and formation mechanisms in a control process.",

  "abstract": "A versatile method for selectively synthesizing single-crystalline rhombic dodecahedral, cubic, and octahedral palladium nanocrystals, as well as their derivatives with varying degrees of edge- and corner-truncation, was reported for the first time. This is also the first report regarding the synthesis of rhombic dodecahedral palladium nanocrystals. All the nanocrystals were readily synthesized by a seed-mediated method with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide as surfactant, KI as additive, and ascorbic acid as reductant. At the same ascorbic acid concentration, a series of palladium nanocrystals with varying shapes were obtained through manipulation of the concentration of KI and the reaction temperature. The formation of different palladium facets were correlated with their growth conditions. In the absence of KI, the {100} palladium facets are favored. In the presence of KI, the concentration of KI and the reaction temperature play an important role on the formation of different palladium facets. The {110} palladium facets are favored at relatively high temperatures and medium KI concentrations. The {111} palladium facets are favored at relatively low temperatures and medium KI concentrations. The {100} palladium facets are favored at either very low or relatively high KI concentrations. These correlations were explained in terms of surface-energy and growth kinetics. These results provide a basis for gaining mechanistic insights into the growth of well-faceted metal nanostructures.",

After 5 min, 160 \u03bcL of freshly prepared 100 mM ascorbic acid solution was added, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 20 min. The nanocube solution was stored at 30 \u00b0C for future use as seeds.\nSeed-Mediated Growth of Polyhedral Palladium Nanocrystals\nIn a typical synthesis, a given amount of KI solutions were added to 5 mL of 100 mM CTAB solution kept at a given temperature. A 125 \u03bcL portion of 10 mM H2PdCl4 solution and 40 \u03bcL of the as-synthesized seed palladium nanocubes solution were then added. Finally, 50 \u03bcL of freshly prepared 100 mM ascorbic acid solution was added, and the solution was mixed thoroughly. The resulting solution was placed in a water bath at designated temperatures. Reactions at the same temperature were set up in parallel. The reaction time for reactions at 30, 40, 50, 60, and 80 \u00b0C were approximately 40, 15, 6, 2, and 1 h, respectively. The reactions were stopped by centrifugation (6000 rpm, 10 min). The precipitates were redispersed in doubly distilled water for UV\u2212vis extinction spectra characterization. Two more centrifugations (6000 rpm, 10 min) were applied to the samples for scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), and XRD characterization."

  "abstract": "Nearly monodisperse Pd nanocubes with controllable sizes were synthesized through a seed-mediated growth approach. By using Pd nanocubes of 22 nm in size as seeds, the morphology of the as-grown nanostructures was fixed as single-crystalline, which enabled us to rationally tune the size of Pd nanocubes. The formation mechanism of initial 22 nm nanocubes was also discussed. The size-dependent surface plasmon resonance properties of the as-synthesized Pd nanocubes were investigated. Compared with previous methods, the yield, monodispersity, perfection of the shape formation, and the range of size control of these nanocubes are all improved. These Pd nanocubes may have potential interests in surface-enhanced Raman scattering, sensors, catalysis, study of size-dependent properties, and fabrication of high-order structures.",

  "experimental": "K2PdCl4 was reduced by ascorbic acid in the presence of CTAB and trisodium citrate. A \u201cstock\u201d solution was made by mixing aqueous solutions of K2PdCl4 and CTAB. Upon mixing, the solution changed color from light yellow to orange. A similar phenomenon had been reported by Murphy and colleagues6e when they mixed CTAB solution with HAuCl4 solution and then made Au nanorods later. Esumi and colleagues24 claimed that AuCl4- formed an ion pair with CTA+ in their synthetic procedures of making fiber-like Au particles. Therefore, we believed that the color changing upon mixing might indicate the formation of the CTA+[PdCl4]2- complex ions. The stock solution consisted of 2.5 \u00d7 10-4 M K2PdCl4 and 8 \u00d7 10-3 M CTAB in water. Six clean centrifuge tubes containing different amounts of trisodium citrate dihydrate were labeled A, B, C, D, E, and F. Into each tube we placed 45 mL of the stock solution, which dissolved trisodium citrate completely in a few seconds. The concentrations of trisodium citrate were 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0 \u00d7 10-3 M in tubes A, B, C, D, E, and F, respectively. Then 250 \u03bcL of 0.1 M freshly prepared ascorbic acid aqueous solution was added to each of the six tubes. Within 15 min, the color of the mixture changed from orange to dark brown. Four days later the mixture in each of the six tubes was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 20 min to remove most of the surfactant, and then a small amount of fresh water was added to get homogeneous black suspensions, which were stable over a few months. The suspensions were labeled as samples A, B, C, D, E, and F, respectively."

  "abstract": "Nearly monodisperse single-crystalline palladium (Pd) nanocubes and nanodendrites have been successfully prepared in aqueous solution at room temperature, for the first time, mainly by utilizing the equilibrium between the dissolution and precipitation of the Pd-cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (Pd-CTAB) complexes. The morphology of the obtained Pd nanocrystals can be tuned by the addition of foreign halide ions (Cl\u2212 and Br\u2212). The corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns confirmed that the synthesis of nanocubes and nanodendrites are single-crystalline pure Pd structures with fcc crystal lattice. A preliminary formation mechanism based on the dissolution and precipitation of the Pd-CTAB complexes and competitive adsorption between different ions on the nanoparticle surface has been proposed.",

Typically, the Na2PdCl4 and CTAB solutions were added to the AA solution in the following two different ways. In the first method (method A), 1 mL of 10 mM Na2PdCl4 was mixed with 1 mL of 10 mM CTAB, and the mixture was then dripped into a flask containing 4 mL of 25 mM AA over a period of 5 min. The whole solution was kept under stirring for an hour. In the second method (method B), 1 mL of 10 mM Na2PdCl4 and 1 mL of 10 mM CTAB were injected simultaneously into a flask containing 4 mL of 25 mM AA with a homemade two-channel syringe pump at a rate of 12 mL/h. The whole solution was then kept under stirring for another 30 min. All reactions were performed at room temperature. In another set of experiments, Pd nanodendrites were obtained by the addition of 1 mL of 0.1 M NaCl to Na2PdCl4 prior to addition of the CTAB and AA, and other conditions were the same as described in method A. When it is necessary, NaI and NaBr were used occasionally instead of NaCl. The products from each method were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 20 min; the precipitates were then collected and redispersed in water, followed by centrifugation at the same speed for 20 min. This step was then repeated twice to remove the unreacted AA and CTAB. Finally, the precipitates were dispersed in water for further analyses."

  "abstract": "The trans-2-phenylvinylboronic acid homocoupling reaction catalyzed by palladium nanocubes (Pd-NCs) was investigated by kinetics, spectroscopy, and poisoning experiments. The reaction was evidenced to be sensitive to the presence of the base, which acts synergistically with the substrate molecules and assists the leaching of Pd oxide (PdOx) species to the reaction medium. This species catalyzes the homocoupling reaction through the formation of Pd\u2013Ox\u2013B(OH)2R pretransmetalation intermediates, via coordination with the vinylboronic acid molecules, involving an oxo-palladium-type interaction. The reaction rate was not enhanced by the saturation of the reaction medium with O2, which is due to the oxidized nature of the Pd-NC surface.",

  "abstract": "The sonochemical synthesis of stable palladium nanoparticles has been achieved by ultrasonic irradiation of palladium(II) nitrate solution. The starting solutions were prepared by the addition of different concentrations of palladium(II) nitrate in ethylene glycol and poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP). The resulting mixtures were irradiated with ultrasonic 50 kHz waves in a glass vessel for 180 min. The UV\u2212visible absorption spectroscopy and pH measurements revealed that the reduction of Pd(II) to metallic Pd has been successfully achieved and that the obtained suspensions have a long shelf life. The protective effect of PVP was studied using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. It has been found that, in the presence of ethylene glycol, the stabilization of the nanoparticles results from the adsorption of the PVP chain on the palladium particle surface via the coordination of the PVP carbonyl group to the palladium atoms. The effect of the initial Pd(II) concentration on the Pd nanoparticle morphology has been investigated by transmission electron microscopy. It has been shown that the increase of the Pd(II)/PVP molar ratio from 0.13 \u00d7 10-3 to 0.53 \u00d7 10-3 decreases the number of palladium nanoparticles with a slight increase in particle size. For the highest Pd(II)/PVP value, 0.53 \u00d7 10-3, the reduction reaction leads to the unexpected smallest nanoparticles in the form of aggregates.",

  "abstract": "The mean diameter of monodispersed Pd nanoparticles could be controlled from 17 to 30 \u00c5 in a one-step reaction by changing the amount of protective polymer, poly(N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone) (PVP) and the kind and/or the concentration of alcohol in the solvent. Although increasing the amount of protective polymer made the size of Pd nanoparticles smaller, the particle size appeared to have a lower limit determined by the kind of alcohol. On the other hand, monodispersed Pd nanoparticles of smaller diameter were obtained in the order methanol > ethanol > 1-propanol, indicating that a faster reduction rate of [PdCl4]2- ions is an important factor to produce the smaller particles. The particle diameter showed a minimum at around 40 vol % of alcohol in solvent. Once the monodispersed Pd nanoparticles were obtained, the larger particles with a narrow size distribution could be easily synthesized by using the stepwise growth reaction. The Pd nanoparticles obtained here had fcc structures like that of bulk Pd, although the lattice constant increased with a decrease in the particle size.",

The average diameter of the particles was estimated to be 2.1 \u00b1 0.7 nm from observation by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis revealed that the particles contained Pd(0) with little amounts of Pd(II) or Pd(IV), in sharp contrast to the thiol- or phosphine-stabilized palladium nanoparticles. The absorption and desorption of hydrogen were reversible, and the reactions were much faster for the nanoparticles than for the bulk palladium metal, whereas the storage capacity was almost the same, 0.6 wt %.",

Superhydride (LiBEt3H, 30 mL, 30.0 mmol, 1.0 M THF solution) was subsequently added to the solution, and immediately the solution turned dark brown. The mixture was vigorously stirred for 30 min. Then n-octyl isocyanide (2.78 g, 20 mmol) was added into the obtained dispersion. The mixture was stirred for another 15 min, and the solvent was removed by evaporation until only a small volume remained. Methanol (100 mL) was added, and the precipitate was collected on a poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) membrane filter. Reprecipitation with methanol was repeated to ensure the removal of any unbound isocyanide and surfactant in the product. Finally, the nanoparticles were characterized by 1H NMR, FT-IR, UV\u2212vis, elemental analysis, and TEM. All processes were carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere."

The particles were synthesized in a biphasic system, and the formation appeared to involve a dynamic process, where initially larger particles were quickly formed, followed by decomposition into smaller and more stable particles. The solution color was found to change concurrently. With varied synthetic conditions, the particle size was found to vary and fall mainly within the size range of 1\u22125 nm in diameter with modest dispersity as determined by transmission electron microscopy. UV\u2212vis spectroscopic measurements showed a Mie scattering profile, but no well-defined surface\u2212plasmon resonance. FTIR studies indicated that the monolayers became more ordered with longer chain lengths of the protecting alkanethiolates. Electrochemical studies exhibited the solution-phase Coulomb staircase charging of the particle double layers, analogous to the observations with gold particles, where the peak spacings corresponded to a (sub)attofarad capacitance for the palladium particles.",

A total of 80 mL of toluene with 1.1 g of TOABr was then added into this solution, where the bright orange/red Pd(II) was transferred from the aqueous phase to the toluene phase. The aqueous phase was then removed, and a calculated amount of C6SH was injected into the toluene solution (depending on the desired C6SH:Pd ratio). The solution was stirred for about 20 min, and then 0.39 g of NaBH4 in 20 mL of H2O was added quickly into the solution, where, after a few seconds delay, the solution color changed rapidly from orange/red to dark green/black, indicating the formation of palladium particles, akin to the case of gold nanoparticles where the color changed from bright red to dark brown/black.11 Here it should be noted that the resulting particles were referred to by their specific experimental conditions, for instance, C6Pd (rt, 1/2\u00d7) refers to the particles synthesized in a solution kept at room temperature with a molar ratio C6S:Pd = 1:2; while for C6Pd (0 \u00b0C, 3\u00d7), the solution was kept at 0 \u00b0C prior to the addition of NaBH4, with C6S:Pd = 3:1."

  "abstract": "A new, facile, general one-phase synthesis for thiol-functionalized gold, palladium, and iridium nanoparticles, using tetrahydrofuran (THF) as the solvent and lithium triethylborohydride (Superhydride) as the reducing agent, is presented. For octadecanethiol-functionalized gold (Au/ODT) nanoparticles, HRTEM of drop-cast particle-films revealed the formation of spherical particles of d = 4 \u00b1 0.3 nm average size. Electron diffraction shows fcc packing arrangement, similar to that of bulk gold. The crystalline gold cores are surrounded with closely packed n-alkyl chains mainly in an all-trans conformation, adopting orthorhombic packing as confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy. Particles are arranged in a discrete solidlike assembly with a correlation length of \u223c5 nm, as the interparticle distance (center-to-center) and a constant edge-to-edge distance of 1 nm as shown by FFT analysis. Using the same synthetic procedure gold nanoparticles functionalized with 11-hydroxyundecane-1-thiol and with 4\u2018-bromo-4-mercaptobiphenyl were prepared. TEM images of drop-cast Pd/ODT and Ir/ODT nanoparticles show an average size of 2.25 nm for the former, while for the latter the distribution is broader with the majority of particles between 2.25 and 4.25 nm. Both nanoparticles are crystalline with fcc packing. FTIR spectroscopy reveals that octadecyl chains are close-packed in all-trans conformation, and that there is presumably one chain in unit cell.",

  "abstract": "The catalytic activity of noble-metal nanocrystals is mainly determined by their sizes and the facets exposed on the  surface.  For  single  crystals,  it  has  been  demonstrated  that  the  Pd(100) surface  is  catalytically  more  active than  both  Pd(110)  and  Pd(111)  surfaces  for  the  CO  oxidation  reaction.  Here  we  report  the  synthesis  of  Pd nanocrystals enclosed by {100} facets with controllable sizes in the range of 6\u201318 nm by manipulating the rate of reduction of the precursor. UV\u2013vis spectroscopy studies indicate that the rate of reduction of Na2PdCl4 can be controlled  by  adjusting  the  concentrations  of  Br\u2013  and  Cl\u2013  ions  added  to  the  reaction  mixture.  Pd  nanocrystals  with different sizes were immobilized on ZnO nanowires and evaluated as catalysts for CO oxidation. We found that the activity of this catalytic system for CO oxidation showed a strong dependence on the nanocrystal size. When  the  size  of  the  Pd  nanocrystals  was  reduced  from  18  nm  to  6  nm,  the  maximum  conversion  rate  was  significantly enhanced by a factor of ~10 and the corresponding maximum conversion temperature was lowered by ~80 \u00b0C.",

  "abstract": "In this paper, we present a \u201cgreen\u201d and size-controlled seed-mediated growth method by which differently sized palladium (Pd) nanoparticles, spanning from 3.4 to 7.6 nm, with an increment of 1.4 nm, were synthesized. Monodisperse Pd nanoparticles (ca. 3.4 nm, standard deviation = 0.7 nm) were first synthesized and stabilized in an aqueous solution at 95 \u00b0C using nontoxic ascorbic acid and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) as reducing agent and capping agent, respectively. These Pd nanoparticles were subsequently employed as seeds on the surface of which fresh Pd 2+ ions were reduced by the weak reducing agent ascorbic acid. Optimal conditions were determined that favored the homogeneous and sequential accumulation of Pd atoms on the surface of the Pd seeds, rather than the formation of new nucleation sites in the bulk growth solution, thereby achieving atomic-level control over particle sizes. The adsorbed CMC molecules did not inhibit the addition of Pd atoms onto the seeds during the growth but provided stabilization of the Pd nanoparticles in aqueous solution after the growth. Potential mechanisms that underpin this seed-mediated growth process are provided and discussed. One advantage of this seed growth process is that it provides stoichiometric control over the size of the Pd nanoparticles by simply varying Pd2+ added during the growth stage. Furthermore, the use of ecologically friendly reagents, such as water (solvent), CMC (capping agent), and ascorbic acid (reducing agent), in both the seed synthesis and subsequent seed-mediated growth provides both \u201cgreen\u201d and economic attributes to this process.",

  "experimental": "Synthesis of Pd Nanoparticle Seeds\nThe Pd nanoparticle seeds were synthesized by reducing Pd2+ in a CMC aqueous solution at 95 \u00b0C using l-ascorbic acid as reducing agent. First, 250 mL of a 0.15 wt % CMC aqueous solution was introduced into a 500 mL volumetric flask and gradually heated to 95 \u00b0C using a stirred/hot plate followed by the addition of 1000 \u03bcL of a 0.05 M Na2PdCl4\u00b73H2O aqueous solution under stirring (700 rpm). Subsequently, 3000 \u03bcL of a 0.05 M l-ascorbic acid aqueous solution was added under constant stirring (700 rpm) and allowed to proceed for a reduction reaction at 95 \u00b0C for 5 min. Finally, the reaction system (i.e., volumetric flask) was moved from the hot stir plate to a room temperature (\u223c23 \u00b0C) stir plate and then aged for about 24 h under stirring (300 rpm) prior to transmission electron microscopy characterization of these Pd nanoparticle seeds. As will be shown later in this paper, the average size of the Pd nanoparticle seeds is 3.4 nm.\nSeed-Mediated Growth Processes\nAfter the Pd nanoparticle seeds were aged for 24 h, a seed-mediated growth process was performed. The Pd seeds were first mixed with a certain amount of Pd salt followed by a gradual addition of ascorbic acid solution. Using the 3.4 nm Pd nanoparticles as seeds, it was desired to further control the sequential growth of Pd atoms on the surfaces of the seeds through Pd2+ salt addition/reduction, thereby achieving differently sized Pd nanoparticles depending on the amount of Pd2+ salt added into the system during the growth stage. The amount of Pd2+ salt added in the system for a desired degree of growth was estimated per the following mass balance equation:\nwhere RPd2+ is the molar ratio of the Pd2+ added in the growth stage relative to the Pd2+ used for seed synthesis, Rs is the radius of the seeds, and Rd is the radius of the desired particle obtained upon growth. This equation applies provided that (i) the Pd2+ salt added during the growth was completely reduced, (ii) the growth occurs homogeneously on the surface of the Pd nanoparticle seeds, and (iii) the reduction occurs in such a manner that no new nucleation sites are formed in the bulk solution during the growth stage (i.e., a weak reducing agent is needed for avoiding formation of new particles).\nIn this study, it was desired to grow Pd nanoparticles in 1.4 nm increments from the 3.4 nm seeds. The mass balance expression (eq 1) was used to determine the amount of the Pd2+ salt addition required to grow Pd nanoparticles to the sizes 4.8, 6.2, and 7.6 nm. Three sets of 250 mL flasks were labeled I, II, and III, respectively. For the growth of 4.8 nm Pd nanoparticles, 360 \u03bcL of a 0.05 M Na2PdCl4\u00b73H2O aqueous solution was added to 50 mL of the aqueous Pd nanoparticle seed dispersion in flask (I) and then stirred (700 rpm) for 3 h to allow a complete mixing of the Pd2+ with the Pd nanoparticle seeds at room temperature. Next, 1800 \u03bcL of a 0.03 M l-ascorbic acid aqueous solution was slowly added (dropwise) under stirring (700 rpm). In flask (II), for the growth of 6.2 nm Pd nanoparticles, 50 mL of the aqueous Pd nanoparticle seed dispersion was initially mixed with 1000 \u03bcL of a 0.05 M Na2PdCl4\u00b73H2O aqueous solution and stirred (700 rpm) for 3 h. This was followed by slow addition (dropwise) of 5000 \u03bcL of a 0.03 M l-ascorbic acid aqueous solution under stirring (700 rpm) at room temperature. In flask (III), for the growth of 7.6 nm Pd nanoparticles, 50 mL of the aqueous Pd nanoparticle seed dispersion was mixed with 2040 \u03bcL of a 0.05 M Na2PdCl4\u00b73H2O aqueous solution and stirred (700 rpm) for 3 h at room temperature. Subsequently, 10\u2009200 \u03bcL of a 0.03 M l-ascorbic acid aqueous solution was slowly added (dropwise) under stirring (700 rpm). After the addition of the ascorbic acid solutions, the stirring speed was changed to 300 rpm where the growth systems were aged for 7 h. The resulting Pd nanoparticles dispersions were then characterized and employed in phase transfer/extraction experiments. In the experiments where the NaBH4 (0.03 M) was used as reducing agent, the procedures are same as those described above."

  "abstract": "Ordered palladium nanowire (NW) arrays with high aspect ratio have been synthesized using porous alumina templates and direct-current electrodeposition. The porous alumina films were prepared by double anodizing high purity aluminium foils in oxalic and sulphuric acids at 40 and 25 V, respectively. Final pore size of the processed (free-standing) alumina templates were determined to be \u223c65 and 35 nm. The electrolyte consisted of 70 mM K2PdCl4 in 20 mM H2SO4 and the deposition voltage was 0.3 V (versus Ag/AgCl reference electrode). Under the employed conditions, a high filling rate (>90%) was obtained using 65 \u03bcm thick templates. The NWs synthesized in 65 nm pores were polycrystalline and textured, but those in 35 nm pores were single-crystalline. It is suggested that deposition in smaller pores proceeds under smaller overpotential due to diffusion-limitation which favors single-crystalline growth. In order to obtain self-standing Pd NWs, which may be interesting for realizing NW-array based gas sensor structures, the alumina template was dissolved away, leaving self-standing NWs supported on a conductive thin film. Such NWs were observed to form agglomerates and chemisorb O and C as surface impurities.",

Briefly, Al foils were first cleaned in acetone, annealed in N2 at 500 \u00b0C for 4 h, and then electropolished at 48 V in a perchloric acid:ethanol (1:5, v/v, ratio) mixture. Anodization was performed potentiostatically in 0.3 M oxalic acid at 40 V or in 0.3 M sulphuric acid at 25 V. The electrolyte temperature was kept constant at 15 \u00b0C and the anodization time was 8 h in all cases. After the first anodization, the oxide film with a low pore ordering was removed in 5 wt.% phosphoric acid:1.8 wt.% chromic acid at 70 \u00b0C. Second anodization resulted in the formation of a highly ordered porous alumina film. Self-standing AAO templates were obtained by dissolving first the non-oxidized Al in 5.2 wt.% mercury chloride and then the barrier layer (i.e., unopened side of the porous alumina tubes) in 5 wt.% phosphoric acid at 35 \u00b0C. Pores were rounded and further widened by dipping the membranes in 5 wt.% phosphoric acid for a few min.\n\nPrior to NW deposition, one face of the membrane was sputter-coated with a thin Au film and subsequently reinforced with a \u223c1 \u03bcm electrodeposited Pd film. The template was then sealed and its non-coated part was exposed to the electrolyte compartment of the electrodeposition cell. The empty pores were then wetted with de-ionized water by ultrasonic agitation to facilitate electrodeposition of Pd NWs. Finally, the water in the cell was removed and replaced immediately with the deposition electrolyte that consisted of 70 mM K2PdCl4 in 20 mM H2SO4. Pd electrodeposition was carried out at 0.3 V Ag/AgCl in all cases. We note that a similar electrolyte with up to 1 mM K2PdCl4 was previously used by Naohara et al. to grow ultrathin Pd films on Au single-crystals [12]. In some cases, the alumina template was removed by soaking the sample in a 0.1 M NaOH solution for 24 h, in order to obtain and study the characteristics of liberated Pd NWs."

  "experimental": "The synthesis of palladium nanowires is as follows. First, gold seeds, with a diameter of 2.2 nm, stabilized by as-prepared TFIL, were prepared by following the modified procedures described in [28] in overexcessive TFIL. In the next step, an excess amount of sodium borohydride was added to the mixture containing 10 ml of 1.0 mM H2PdCl4 and 0.5 ml of 2.2 nm as-prepared gold seeds under vigorous stirring at room temperature. The brown colour of the gold sol changed to the dark brown colour of palladium colloid, suggesting the formation of palladium nanostructures. The stabilized nanocomposite could be purified by removing excess unbound ionic liquid and inorganic components with ethanol. The nanocomposite was precipitated, and the supernatant liquid was removed by ethanol. The purified as-obtained nanocomposite could be redispersed into water for the morphology, elemental composition, and crystal structure characterizations. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images (figures 2(a)\u2013(c)) and selected area electron diffraction patterns (SAED; see the inset in figure 2(a)) were taken with a JEOL JEM-2010 transmission electron microscope. The energy dispersive x-ray spectrum in an SEM (EDS, figure 2(d)) was obtained in Philips XL30 ESEM. The x-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern was recorded using a Rigaku D/Max 2500 V x-ray diffractometer with high-intensity Cu K\u03b11 radiation (\u03bb = 1.540\u200956 \u00c5, figure 3). The TEM samples were prepared by placing a drop of solution onto a carbon-coated copper grid and allowing evaporation of the solvent. Samples for XRD measurement were prepared by placing precipitated nanocomposite onto a glass substrate which was left to dry in air."

  "abstract": "Palladium wavy nanowires with an ultrathin diameter of 2 nm are synthesized using the polyol method without the involvement of any template. The success of this synthesis relies on the use of a suitable precursor that could be reduced instantaneously to generate a large number of small Pd nanoparticles. Due to a quick depletion of precursor, the small nanoparticles were unable to grow in size through atomic addition. In the case of low surface charges and high surface energies, these small nanoparticles were forced to coalesce into ultrathin nanowires with a wavy morphology via an attachment mechanism. Thanks to the unique structure and involvement of twin defects, the as-obtained Pd ultrathin nanowires show a catalytic current density of 2.5 times higher than the conventional Pd/C catalyst towards formic acid oxidation. This work not only offers a powerful route to the synthesis of nanowires through attachment-based growth but also opens the door to the rational design and fabrication of novel metal nanostructures with enhanced properties.",

  "experimental": "In a typical synthesis, poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) (colloidal stabilizer) and (CF3COO)2Pd (precursor) were dissolved separately in diethylene glycol (DEG) (solvent and reductant). The solution containing (CF3COO)2Pd was quickly injected into the PVP solution at 140 \u00b0C under magnetic stirring. The solution turned into black immediately after the introduction of precursor, implying the formation of Pd nanoparticles due to the reduction of (CF3COO)2Pd by DEG. The reaction was terminated after 3 h, and Pd nanowires with a wavy morphology were obtained. Figure 1a and b shows TEM images of a typical sample of the Pd nanowires under low- and high-magnifications, respectively. The TEM images indicated that the Pd wavy nanowires were obtained with a high purity approaching 100%. The nanowires were 2.0 \u00b1 0.6 nm in width and several tens to hundreds of nanometers in length. Figure 1c shows high-resolution bright-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (BF-STEM) image of the Pd nanowires, where the lattice fringes could be clearly resolved. The lattice spacing of each group of parallel fringes was 0.23 nm, corresponding to the (111) planes of face-centered cubic (fcc) Pd. It should be noted that each nanowire was composed of a number of interconnected, single-crystal building blocks, which merged together from different angles. As a result, twin defects could be readily observed along each nanowire where coalescence took place. The high-resolution high-angle annular dark-field STEM (HAADF-STEM) images recorded from two individual Pd nanowires are shown in Figure 1d and e, respectively, further revealing that the coalescence between two building blocks could involve single-crystal structure with the same lattice plane or twin boundaries (TB). X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern shown in Figure S1 of the Supporting Information indicated that the as-obtained nanowires were composed of the element Pd only, because all the diffraction peaks could be indexed to the fcc Pd (JCPDS No. 05\u20130681). The broadening of the peaks can be attributed to the relatively small cross sections of the nanowires."

  "abstract": "This article reports the design and successful implementation of a one-pot, polyol method for the synthesis of penta-twinned Pd nanowires with diameters below 8 nm and aspect ratios up to 100. The key to the success of this protocol is the controlled reduction of Na2PdCl4 by diethylene glycol and ascorbic acid through the introduction of NaI and HCl. The I\u2013 and H+ ions can slow the reduction kinetics by forming PdI42\u2013 and inhibiting the dissociation of ascorbic acid, respectively. When the initial reduction rate is tuned into the proper regime, Pd decahedral seeds with a penta-twinned structure appear during nucleation. In the presence of I\u2013 ions as a selective capping agent toward the Pd(100) surface, the decahedral seeds can be directed to grow axially into penta-twinned nanorods and then nanowires. The Pd nanowires are found to evolve into multiply twinned particles if the reaction time is extended beyond 1.5 h, owing to the involvement of oxidative etching. When supported on carbon, the Pd nanowires show greatly enhanced specific electrocatalytic activities, more than five times the value for commercial Pd/C toward formic acid oxidation and three times the value for Pt/C toward oxygen reduction under an alkaline condition. In addition, the carbon-supported Pd nanowires exhibit greatly enhanced electrocatalytic durability toward both reactions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Pd nanowires can serve as sacrificial templates for the conformal deposition of Pt atoms to generate Pd@Pt core\u2013sheath nanowires and then Pd\u2013Pt nanotubes with a well-defined surface structure.",

The average particle size of Pt and Pd nanoparticles, which are uniformly dispersed on carbon, is 4 and 5 nm, respectively. The Pt/C and Pd/C catalysts exhibit four diffraction peaks that are indexed to the {1 1 1}, {2 0 0}, {2 2 0}, and {3 1 1} planes of Pt and Pd, respectively. The electrooxidation of formic acid is examined by cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. The Pd/C catalyst is found to have a higher electrocatalytic activity for formic acid oxidation than a comparative Pt/C catalyst. Preliminary data from a single-stack test cell of a direct formic acid fuel cell (DFAFC) using Pd/C as the anode catalyst yield high power density.",

The Pd nanowire arrays, in this paper, have high electrochemical active surface and show excellent catalytic properties for ethanol electrooxidation in alkaline media. The activity of Pd nanowire arrays for ethanol oxidation is not only higher that of Pd film, but also higher than that of commercial E-TEK PtRu(2:1 by weight)/C. The micrometer sized pores and channels in nanowire arrays act as structure units. They make liquid fuel diffuse into and products diffuse out of the catalysts layer much easier, therefore, the utilization efficiency of catalysts gets higher.

First, a thin gold film was sputtered onto one side of the template that was further reinforced electrochemically by a Cu layer with a thickness of few microns. This back-layer (Au + Cu) served as cathode during the electrochemical deposition of the Pd nanowires. The electrolyte consisted of aqueous solution of 20 gl\u22121 K2PdCl4 and 20 gl\u22121 H2SO4. For fabrication of nanowires, direct current (DC) electrochemical deposition was employed with platinum rod used as the anode. The deposition process was monitored by recording current versus time curves. To make sure that the nanopores are completely filled, an overgrowth of nanowires was intentionally adopted, which resulted in the formation caps on the surface of the template."
