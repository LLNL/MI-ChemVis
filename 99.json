The mixture was left for 24 h before similarly reducing the Au (III) solution in a second test-tube (tube 2) with ascorbic acid, and then adding 1 ml of the aged solution from tube 1. This procedure was then repeated after a further 24 h such that successive transfers of 1 ml of aged solutions into freshly reduced solutions proceeded from tube 2 to 3, and then from 3 to 4.\n",

A mixture of 9.63 mL of CTAB 0.1 M with 50 \u03bcL of K2PtCl4 0.05 M was heated up to 40 \u00b0C for 5 min until the solution became clear. After adding 0.3 mL of NaBH4 0.06 M, the vial was capped immediately. After 10 min, the vial was opened and stirred for several minutes until the decomposition of the NaBH4. The synthesis of Au NCs stabilized in CTAB were prepared via the method developed by Nikoobakht and El-Sayed. Briefly, 5 mL CTAB solution 0.2 M was mixed with 5 mL of HAuCl4 solution 0.0005 M. Next, 0.6 mL of freshly prepared NaBH4 0.01 M was added to the mixture while vigorously stirring, which resulted in the formation of a light-brown solution within few seconds. Stirring of the solution was continued for 2 min. Growth solution was prepared by mixing 5 mL of CTAB 0.2 M and 5 mL of HAuCl4 0.001 M. After that, 50 \u03bcL of AA 0.1 M was added as a mild reducing agent, changing the growth solution from dark yellow to colorless. Then, a volume between 5 and 30 \u03bcL of the presynthesized Pt seeds was added and gently mixed for 10 s. The solution was kept at RT without stirring for 1 month. Three different volumes (0.015, 0.15, and 1.5 mL) of K2PtCl4 solution 0.004 M were added to 5 mL CTAB solution 0.2 M. Then, 5 mL of HAuCl4 0.001 M and 55 \u03bcL of AA 0.1 M were added simultaneously to the solutions dropwise, and then gently mixed for 10 s. The final step was the addition of 12 \u03bcL of the presynthesized Au NC seed solution to the growth solutions. The solutions were kept at RT.\n",

After the autoclave was cooled to room temperature naturally, the resulting precipitates were separated and washed three times by centrifugation. The above synthesized Ag NPs were added into a solution containing 25 mL of water, 15 mL of ethanol, 75 mg of CTAB and 0.25 mL of aqueous solution of ammonia. After being agitated ultrasonically for 30 min, 120 \u03bcL of TEOS was added dropwise into the solution with continuous stirring for about 10 seconds and the reaction was continued for 1 h. The particles were collected by centrifugation and washed with ethanol and water, respectively. The CTAB surfactant was removed by dissolving the sample in acetone for 6 h to form the mesoporous shell. 0.1 g AgNO3 was first dissolved into a mixed solution of water and ammonia (water 2 mL, ammonia 0.2 mL), and 1 g PVP was added into 13 mL Ag@MSiO2 (2 M) ethanol solution. The above two solutions were then mixed together and fully dispersed under magnetic stirring. After that, the mixed solution was transferred to a 20 mL autoclave, sealed and maintained at 120 \u00b0C for 12 h.\n",

The solution color changed from yellow to brownish-yellow, and the stirring was stopped after 2 min. The seed solution was aged at room temperature for 30 min before use. To prepare the growth solution, 9.0 g of CTAB together with defined amounts of additives (Table S1) were dissolved in 250 mL of warm water (50\u201370 \u00b0C, depending on the additive) in a 500 mL Erlenmeyer flask. The solution was allowed to cool to 30 \u00b0C, when a 4 mM AgNO3 solution, as detailed in Table S1, was added. The mixture was kept undisturbed at 30 \u00b0C for 15 min, after which 250 mL of 1 mM HAuCl4 solution and, if necessary, a small amount of HCl (37 wt % in water, 12.1 M) was added. After 15 min of slow stirring (400 rpm), 0.064 M ascorbic acid (Table S1) was added, and the solution was vigorously stirred for 30 s until it became colorless. The growth solution had a CTAB concentration of about 0.05 M and was used right after preparation. Finally, 0.8 mL of seed solution was injected into the growth solution.

Excess borohydride was consumed by keeping the seed solution for 2 h at room temperature prior to use. In a typical synthesis of 40 mL of a Au NT solution the following two growth solutions were prepared: (1) 1.6 mL of a 0.1 M CTAC solution was added to 8 mL of Milli-Q water, followed by 40 \u03bcL of 0.05 M HAuCl4 solution and 15 \u03bcL of a 0.01 M NaI solution; (2) 500 \u03bcL of a 0.05 M HAuCl4 solution was added to 40 mL of 0.05 M CTAC, followed by 300 \u03bcL of a 0.01 M NaI solution. Before proceeding, the initial seed@CTAC solution was diluted 10\u00d7 in a 0.1 M CTAC solution. Subsequently, 40 and 400 \u03bcL of 0.1 M AA solution were added to solutions 1 and 2, respectively, and both solutions were manually stirred until the complete transparency of the solutions was achieved, indicating AuIII to AuI reduction. Finally, 100 \u03bcL of diluted seed@CTAC solution was added to solution 1 (and manually stirred for 1 s), and immediately 3.2 mL of this solution was added to solution 2 (and manually stirred for a few seconds). The Au NT dispersion was left undisturbed at room temperature for at least 1 h (see SI, Scheme S1, for a schematic representation of the synthetic protocol). We observed that addition of 15 \u03bcL of a 0.01 M NaI solution to solution 1 further improved the yield in NTs obtained with the fast addition procedure. Flocculation of the Au NTs was completed overnight, the supernatant was then removed, and the precipitated particles were redispersed in 5 mL of 0.1 M CTAC solution. The pellet was redispersed in 50 \u03bcL of a 0.1 M CTAC solution and sonicated briefly. Subsequently, water was added to reach a Au0 concentration of 0.5 mM. A 10 mg/mL PVP solution was prepared, sonicated for 10 min, and finally added under vigorous stirring to the Au NTs to achieve a final PVP concentration of 1 mg/mL. This solution was stirred overnight at room temperature.\n",

The fuel was 3 M HCOOH delivered at 2 ml min\u22121 by a micropump and the oxygen flow was regulated by a flowmeter at 500 cm3 min\u22121. In another approach, first used by Yu and co-workers [16] and generally known as the polyol process, an ethylene glycol solution of the metal salt was refluxed at 393\u2013443 K to generate in situ reducing species from ethylene glycol for the reduction of the metallic species. In a 100-ml beaker, 1.0 ml of an aqueous solution of 0.05 M H2PtCl6\u00b76H2O (Aldrich, A.C.S. Reagent) or 0.05 M PdCl2 was mixed with 25 ml of ethylene glycol (Mallinckrodt, AR). Next, 0.4 M KOH was added drop wise to give a total volume of 0.75 (or 0.25 ml) and then 0.040 g of Vulcan XC-72 carbon with a specific BET surface-area of 250 m2 g\u22121 and an average article size of 40 nm was added to the mixture and sonicated. The beaker and its contents were heated in a house-hold microwave oven (National NN-S327WF, 2450 MHz, 700 W) for 50 s. The resulting suspension was filtered and the residue was washed with acetone and dried at 373 K overnight in a vacuum oven.\n",

Subsequently, 3000 \u03bcL of a 0.05 M l-ascorbic acid aqueous solution was added under constant stirring (700 rpm) and allowed to proceed for a reduction reaction at 95 \u00b0C for 5 min. Finally, the reaction system (i.e., volumetric flask) was moved from the hot stir plate to a room temperature (~23 \u00b0C) stir plate and then aged for about 24 h under stirring (300 rpm) prior to transmission electron microscopy characterization of these Pd nanoparticle seeds. After the Pd nanoparticle seeds were aged for 24 h, a seed-mediated growth process was performed. The Pd seeds were first mixed with a certain amount of Pd salt followed by a gradual addition of ascorbic acid solution. For the growth of 4.8 nm Pd nanoparticles, 360 \u03bcL of a 0.05 M Na2PdCl4\u00b73H2O aqueous solution was added to 50 mL of the aqueous Pd nanoparticle seed dispersion in flask (I) and then stirred (700 rpm) for 3 h to allow a complete mixing of the Pd2+ with the Pd nanoparticle seeds at room temperature. Next, 1800 \u03bcL of a 0.03 M l-ascorbic acid aqueous solution was slowly added (dropwise) under stirring (700 rpm). In flask (II), for the growth of 6.2 nm Pd nanoparticles, 50 mL of the aqueous Pd nanoparticle seed dispersion was initially mixed with 1000 \u03bcL of a 0.05 M Na2PdCl4\u00b73H2O aqueous solution and stirred (700 rpm) for 3 h. This was followed by slow addition (dropwise) of 5000 \u03bcL of a 0.03 M l-ascorbic acid aqueous solution under stirring (700 rpm) at room temperature. In flask (III), for the growth of 7.6 nm Pd nanoparticles, 50 mL of the aqueous Pd nanoparticle seed dispersion was mixed with 2040 \u03bcL of a 0.05 M Na2PdCl4\u00b73H2O aqueous solution and stirred (700 rpm) for 3 h at room temperature. Subsequently, 10 200 \u03bcL of a 0.03 M l-ascorbic acid aqueous solution was slowly added (dropwise) under stirring (700 rpm). After the addition of the ascorbic acid solutions, the stirring speed was changed to 300 rpm where the growth systems were aged for 7 h. In the case of the CMC that had been heated to 95 \u00b0C, 250 mL of a 0.15 wt % CMC aqueous solution was introduced into a 500 mL volumetric flask and gradually heated to 95 \u00b0C using a stir/hot plate.

NRs are grown in this mixture either by aging or by addition of a growth solution suitable to shorter NRs. CTAB solution (5 mL, 0.20 M) was mixed with 5.0 mL of 0.00050 M HAuCl4. To the stirred solution, 0.60 mL of ice-cold 0.010 M NaBH4 was added, which resulted in the formation of a brownish yellow solution. Vigorous stirring of the seed solution was continued for 2 min. After the solution was stirred, it was kept at 25 \u00b0C. CTAB (5 mL, 0.20 M) was added to (0.050, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25 mL) of 0.0040 M AgNO3 solution at 25 \u00b0C. To this solution, 5.0 mL of 0.0010 M HAuCl4 was added, and after gentle mixing of the solution 70 \u03bcL of 0.0788 M ascorbic acid was added. The final step was the addition of 12 \u03bcL of the seed solution to the growth solution at 27\u221230 \u00b0C. The color of the solution gradually changed within 10\u221220 min. The temperature of the growth medium was kept constant at 27\u221230 \u00b0C in all the experiments. In both cases a binary surfactant mixture of benzyldimethylhexadecylammoniumchloride (BDAC) and CTAB was used. In the first approach the surfactant mixture was prepared by adding 5 mL of 0.15 M BDAC to 0.010, 0.030, 0.050, 0.080, 0.10, 0.12, and 0.20 g of CTAB for making surfactant mixtures with ratios of 27 to 1.3. After dissolving the mixtures by sonication (20 min at 40 \u00b0C), each solution was added to 200 \u03bcL of 0.0040 M AgNO3. In these solutions the silver content was kept constant while the fraction of the cosurfactant (CTAB) was changed. To this solution, 5.0 mL of 0.0010 M HAuCl4 was added, and after gentle mixing of the solution 70 \u03bcL of 0.0778 M ascorbic acid was added. By aging the NR solution for 7 days, the aspect ratio increases to 9\u221210. The growth process was initiated after adding 12 \u03bcL of seed solution. The growth solution (called B) was prepared by adding 5.0 mL of a mixture of 0.15 M BDAC and 0.10 g of CTAB to 200 \u03bcL of 0.0040 M AgNO3. This solution was then added to 5.0 mL of 0.00050 M HAuCl4 solution. To this solution, 36 \u03bcL of 0.0778 M ascorbic acid was added, which resulted in a colorless solution. The growth solution (B) was added to solution A at a rate of 1.0 mL per 20 min. The growth solution (B) was added to solution A at a rate of 1.0 mL per 20 min. By introducing 12 \u03bcL of the 5-min-aged seed solution to a growth solution, the NRs start to grow.\n",

A 3 mM solution of Na2S (Aldrich, 208043) or NaHS (Aldrich, 161527) in EG was also prepared 45 minutes prior to injection. Shortly after injecting 80 \u03bcL of the sulfide solution, 1.5 mL and 0.5 mL of the PVP and AgNO3 solutions were sequentially injected (all with a micro-pipettor). As silver nitrate was added, the clear and colorless solution immediately turned purple-black, followed instantly by a transparent bright yellow color. In a typical synthesis, a fixed amount (100 \u03bcL) of the as-synthesized silver nanocubes was dispersed in 5 mL water containing 1 mg/mL PVP in a 50 mL flask under magnetic stirring and then heated to boil for 10 minutes. A specific amount (3 mL) of 0.2 mM HAuCl4 aqueous solution was added to the flask through a syringe pump at a rate of 45 mL/h under magnetic stirring. The solution was heated for another 10 minutes until the color of the system was stable.\n",

        "experimentalSentences": "A volume of 10 mL of aqueous solution containing 0.25 mM HAuCl4 and 0.10 M CTAB was prepared in a 20 mL vial. Concurrently, 10 mL of 0.02 M ice-cold NaBH4 was freshly made. Then 450 \u03bcL of the NaBH4 solution was introduced into the CTAB\u2013HAuCl4 solution while stirring vigorously. After stirring for 5 min, the solution was kept undisturbed for 2 h at 27 \u00b0C to decompose excess borohydride by water. First, two 25 mL flasks and one 50 mL conical flask were labeled A, B, and C. For samples a\u2013f, or series I samples (see Table S1 in the Supporting Information), 1.9681 g of CTAB, deionized water (52.569 mL for sample a, 52.596 mL for samples b and e, 52.623 mL for samples c and d, and 52.542 mL for sample f), and 1.35 mL of 0.01 M HAuCl4 solution were mixed. Next, various amounts of NaOH or HNO3 solution were added to the mixture (81, 54, and 27 \u03bcL of 0.5 M NaOH solution for samples a, b, and c and 27, 54, and 108 \u03bcL of 0.5 M HNO3 solution for samples d, e, and f, respectively). At this point, the total solution volume is 54 mL. CTAB and HAuCl4 concentrations in the growth solution are, respectively, 0.1 M and 0.25 mM excluding the volume of ascorbic acid. Then 4.5 mL of the growth solution was added to flasks A and B and 45 mL to flask C. Finally, 25, 25, and 250 \u03bcL of 0.1 M ascorbic acid were, respectively, introduced into flasks A, B, and C. The flasks were gently shaken until the solutions became colorless. Here a mixture of 1.093 g of CTAB, 29.475 mL of deionized water, and 525 \u03bcL of 0.01 M HAuCl4 solution was made first. A volume of 2.5 mL of the solution was transferred to flasks A and B and 25 mL to flask C. CTAB and HAuCl4 concentrations in the growth solution are, respectively, 0.1 M and 0.175 mM excluding the volume of nitric acid and ascorbic acid. Subsequently, 0.5 M HNO3 solution was added to flask C only (0.0504, 0.252, 0.550, 1.1, and 3.0 mL of HNO3 solution for samples g, h, i, j, and k and 0.0504, 0.252, 1.1, 3.0, and 5.0 mL of HNO3 solution for samples l, m, n, o, and p, respectively). Finally, 10, 10, and 100 \u03bcL of 0.1 M ascorbic acid solution was introduced into flasks A, B, and C, respectively. For series I, II, and III samples, 400, 200, and 200 \u03bcL of the gold seed solution was, respectively, added to flask A and shaken slightly for 10 s. Immediately 400 (series I) and 200 \u03bcL (series II and III) of the solution in flask A was transferred to flask B and shaken for 10 s. Finally, 4 mL (series I), 2 mL (series II), and 200 \u03bcL (series III) of the solution in flask B was transferred to flask C and shaken for 5 s. Flask C was left undisturbed for 12 h for completion of nanorod and nanowire growth.\n",

        "experimentalSentences": "The seeds were synthesized according to our method reported previously. Typically this involves the preparation of a 20 mL aqueous solution containing 2.5 \u00d7 10-4 M HAuCl4 and 2.5 \u00d7 10-4 M trisodium citrate. To this solution was added 0.6 mL of ice cold 0.1 M NaBH4 with stirring. The seed particles were stored at 25 \u00b0C for 3 h prior to any further experimentation, to allow excess borohydride to be decomposed by water. A 10 mL sample of the citrate-stabilized seed solution (the 3.5 nm seed solution mentioned above in (a)), aged after 3 h of synthesis, was taken in a conical flask. Next, to this was added 250 \u03bcL of a 10-2 M ethanolic solution of 4-MBA with stirring. Typically, 18 mL of an aqueous solution of 2.5 \u00d7 10-4 M HAuCl4 was prepared in a conical flask. To this solution was added 2 mL of 1 M D-glucose. The solution was heated to 60 \u00b0C, 40 \u03bcL of 1 M NaOH was added, and the resulting solution was subsequently stirred rapidly for 10 s. The seed solution was cooled to room temperature and used directly for all further experiments. Specifically, 100 mL of an aqueous solution of 2.5 \u00d7 10-4 M HAuCl4 was heated to boiling. To this was added 10 mL of an aqueous solution of 1% sodium citrate, and boiling was continued. Next, a growth solution was prepared wherein 100 mL of an aqueous solution of 2.5 \u00d7 10-4 M HAuCl4 was taken in a conical flask. To this was added 3 g of solid CTAB (0.08 M final CTAB concentration), and the resulting solution was heated with stirring. The solution was cooled to room temperature and used as a stock solution.  A 7.5 mL aliquot of the growth solution was mixed with 50 \u03bcL of freshly prepared 0.1 M ascorbic acid solution. Next, 2.5 mL of the 3.5 nm seed solution was added with stirring. Stirring was continued for a further 10 min for complete reduction of the gold salt. A 9 mL sample of the growth solution and 50 \u03bcL of 0.1 M ascorbic acid solution were mixed, and 1.0 mL of the 3.5 nm seed solution was added with vigorous stirring. Stirring was continued for an additional 10 min. The final color of the solution was dark red, and the particles prepared by this method were 8.0 \u00b1 0.8 nm. A 9 mL sample of the growth solution was mixed with 50 \u03bcL of 0.1 M ascorbic acid solution, and 1.0 mL of the 8.0 nm seed solution (as synthesized above) was added with vigorous stirring. Specifically, to a 10 mL 0.1 M aqueous solution of CTAB was added 250 \u03bcL of 0.01 M HAuCl4. To the stirred solution was added 0.60 mL of 0.01 M sodium borohydride, which resulted in the formation of a brown-yellow solution. Vigorous stirring of the seed solution, which was kept at 25 \u00b0C, was continued for 2 min. This seed solution was further used for the synthesis of gold nanorods after 30 min of its synthesis. Gold nanorods were synthesized by the three-step seeding protocol as described previously. Specifically, two 20 mL conical flasks and one 100 mL conical flask (labeled A, B, and C, respectively) were taken. To these flasks were added 9 mL (in flasks A and B) and 45 mL (in flask C) of growth solution containing a mixture of 2.5 \u00d7 10-4 M HAuCl4 and 0.1 M CTAB solutions. To these solutions were added 50 \u03bcL (flasks A and B) and 250 \u03bcL (flask C) of 0.1 M freshly prepared ascorbic acid, and the resulting solutions were stirred gently. The orange color of the gold salt in the CTAB solution disappeared when ascorbic acid was added. After 15 s, 1.0 mL of sample A was mixed with sample B (step 2). A 5.0 mL portion of sample B was further added to sample C after 30 s (step 3). In all cases, each flask was gently stirred to homogenize the solutions. The solution in flask C was kept at 25 \u00b0C for a period of 16 h.\n",

In a round-bottom flask, 10 mL of 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22124 M PdCl42\u2212 aqueous solution, prepared by diluting the 2.0 mM PdCl42\u2212 solution, was bubbled with nitrogen for 30 min to remove the dissolved oxygen and prevent reoxidation of the initially formed seed particles. The bubbled solution was injected into a two-neck flask containing 0.3645 g (1 mmol) of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) surfactant (Alfa Aesar, 98%) and stirred until the CTAB powder was dissolved. Concurrently, 10 mL of ice-cold 0.015 M NaBH4 (Aldrich, 98%) solution was prepared in another flask. Next, 220 \u03bcL of the NaBH4 aqueous solution was injected into the solution in the two-neck flask. This solution must be kept under nitrogen to avoid exposure to air. Two 20 mL vials labeled A and B were used. The growth solution was prepared by adding 0.345 g of CTAB powder and 10 mL of 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22124 M PdCl42\u2212 solution into both of these vials and stirred until the CTAB powder was completely dissolved.

The method of producing Pd seeds is similar to our previous reports.20 Briefly, 0.5 mL aliquot of 10 mM H2PdCl4 solution was added to 9420 \u00b5L of 12.5 mM CTAB solution heated at 95 \u00b0C under stirring. After 5 minutes, 80 \u00b5L of freshly prepared 100 mM ascorbic acid solution was added, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 20 min. The nanocube solution was stored at 30 \u00b0C for future use as seeds. Seed-mediated growth of polyhedral palladium nanocrystals. In a typical synthesis, 5 \u00b5L of 1 mM KSCN solution was added to 5 mL of 100 mM CTAB solution kept at a given temperature. 250 \u00b5L of 10 mM H2PdCl4 solution and 80 \u00b5L as-synthesized seed palladium nanocube solution were then added. Finally, 50 \u00b5L of freshly prepared 100 mM ascorbic acid solution was added and the solution was mixed thoroughly.

This solution was kept at 33 \u00b0C for 24 h to completely dissolve the CTAB powder. Further, 20 mL of a seed solution containing small gold particles was prepared. This solution was kept undisturbed for 24 h at room temperature. After 24 h, 80 \u03bcL of a freshly prepared 0.1 M reducing agent solution (8.0 \u00d7 10\u22126 mol reducing agent) were added to 14.4 mL of the growth solution (containing 3.6 \u00d7 10\u22126 mol gold). The solution was mixed by shaking, whereupon it became colourless in the case of ascorbic acid (indication for the reduction of AuIII to AuI) and brighter yellow in the case of hydroquinone. The colour of the solution did not change for the other three used reducing agents. The addition of 16 \u03bcL of the seed solution (aged 24 h, containing 4.0 \u00d7 10\u22129 mol gold) and subsequent mixing of the solution by shaking led to a reddish colour of the solution. In some experiments, sodium hydroxide solution (e.g. 80 \u03bcL, 0.1 M, leading to a final pH around 4) was used to modify the pH value, added to the growth solution just before the addition of seed solution. In this case, after addition of the seed solution the reaction mixture became transparent for all reducing agents after a certain time (if not already transparent before addition of the seed solution).\n",

Other reagents were separately dissolved in DEG and sequentially introduced into the flask using a pipet. Specifically, 0.06 mL of NaSH solution (3 mM) was added first. After 4 min, 0.5 mL of HCl (3 mM) was added, followed by 1.25 mL of PVP (20 mg/mL). After another 2 min, 0.4 mL of CF3COOAg solution (282 mM) was introduced. During the entire process, the flask was capped with glass stoppers except for the addition of reagents. The synthesis was quenched by placing the flask in an ice\u2013water bath and the products were collected by centrifugation, followed by washing with acetone and then DI water to remove the remaining precursor, DEG, and excess PVP.\n",

Anodization was performed potentiostatically in 0.3 M oxalic acid at 40 V or in 0.3 M sulphuric acid at 25 V. The electrolyte temperature was kept constant at 15 \u00b0C and the anodization time was 8 h in all cases. After the first anodization, the oxide film with a low pore ordering was removed in 5 wt.% phosphoric acid:1.8 wt.% chromic acid at 70 \u00b0C. Pores were rounded and further widened by dipping the membranes in 5 wt.% phosphoric acid for a few min. The template was then sealed and its non-coated part was exposed to the electrolyte compartment of the electrodeposition cell. Finally, the water in the cell was removed and replaced immediately with the deposition electrolyte that consisted of 70 mM K2PdCl4 in 20 mM H2SO4. Pd electrodeposition was carried out at 0.3 VAg/AgCl in all cases. In some cases, the alumina template was removed by soaking the sample in a 0.1 M NaOH solution for 24 h, in order to obtain and study the characteristics of liberated Pd NWs. In the case of dp \u2248 35 nm, the current density at first decreases monotonically from 0.4 to 0.3 mA cm\u22122 in 10 min, then remains constant until tdep \u2248 40 min.

In typical experiment, 50 ml of 1 \u00d7 10\u22123 M AgNO3 was heated to boiling. To this solution, 5 ml of 1% trisodium citrate was included drop by drop. Solution was mixed vigorously during this process and heated until the colour change was noticeable (pale brown). Finally, it was removed from the heating element and stirred until cooled to room temperature. The final pH was adjusted to 6.0 and the flasks were incubated in the orbital shaker at 200 rpm at 32 \u00b0C. After five days of incubation, the mycelium was separated by filtration and supernatant was challenged with equal amount of silver nitrate solution of 1 mM (prepared in deionised water) and incubated in shaker at 200 rpm in dark condition at 32 \u00b0C (Figure 1). Simultaneously, a positive control of silver nitrate solution and deionised water, and a negative control containing only silver nitrate solution were maintained under same conditions. The reduction of pure silver ions synthesised by chemical and biological means was monitored by measuring the UV\u2013Vis spectrum of the reaction mixture. One day old bacterial culture was taken (1 \u00d7 105 CFU/ml) and was used to prepare the bacterial lawns. The wells were injected with 60 \u03bcl of biologically synthesised silver nanoparticle solution, 60 \u03bcl of chemically synthesised silver nanoparticle solution, 60 \u03bcl of 1 mM AgNO3 as a negative control along with 60 \u03bcl of 30 \u03bcg/ml of streptomycin as a positive control. The plates were further incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 24 h and were then examined for the presence of zones of inhibition. In the case of chemical synthesis methods, a stabiliser (surfactant) is added to the first solution to prevent the agglomeration of silver nanoparticles, whereas in biological synthesis there is no need to add a stabilising agent.\n",

Double-distilled deionised water was used. For the synthesis of silver nanoparticles, silver nitrate solution (from 1,0 mM to 6,0 mM) and 8% (w/w) Sodium Dodecyl Sulphate (SDS) were used as a metal salt precursor and a stabilizing agent, respectively. Hydrazine hydrate solution with a concentrate ranging from 2,0 mM to 12 mM and Citrate of sodium solution (1,0 mM to 2,0 mM) were used as a reducing agents. Citrate of sodium was also used as stabilizing agent at room temperature. The transparent colourless solution was converted to the characteristic pale yellow and pale red colour, when citrate of sodium was used as stabilizing agent. To remove excess silver ions, the silver colloids were washed at least three times with deionized water under nitrogen stream. A dried powder of the nanosize silver was obtained by freeze-drying. To carry out all characterization methods and interaction of the silver nanoparticles with bacteria, the silver nanoparticle powder in the freeze-drying cuvette was resuspended in deionized water; the suspension was homogenized with a Fisher Bioblock Scientific ultrasonic cleaning container. The colourless Ag+ solution containing SDS turned pale yellow-brown in addition of hydrazine solution (Fig. 1A) and in the case of adding citrate of sodium the colour changed to pale red (Fig 1C). In the case that we do not use SDS the uncolored Ag+ solution turned pale yellow in addition of hydrazine and citrate of sodium solution at different concentrations (Fig. 1B). Ag particles prepared from 1.1 mM AgNO3 solution. Metal ion concentration and citrate of sodium solution 6.0 mM and 2.0 mM, respectively. UV\u2013Vis absorption spectrum of silver nanoparticles prepared using a mixture of hydrazine and citrate of sodium as a reducing agent. TEM image of spherical silver nanoparticles obtained at 1.0 mM (A) and 2.0 mM (B) of citrate of sodium solution. Particle size distributions of Ag nanoparticles (prepared from 1.1 mM AgNO3 solution) and citrate of sodium solution with a concentrate ranging from 1.0 mM (A) to 2.0 mM (B). The silver sols were diluted 2-8 times with 100 \u00edL of Mueller-Hinton broth inoculated with the tested bacteria at a concentration of 105 to 106 CFU/mL. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was read after 24 h of incubation at 37 \u00b0C.\n",

Since PVP is insoluble in acetone, the original slightly yellow powder turns into a paste, whose color changes to dark brown after 35 min of magnetic agitation, indicating the formation of silver nanoparticles in the polymer matrix. The rest of the powder was dissolved in ethylene glycol under magnetic stirring. Therefore, 50 mg AgNO3 (29.4 mmol) were first dissolved in 0.05 mL de-ionized water. Then, 30 mL acetone was added and the resulting solution was mixed under magnetic agitation during 20 min. To this solution, 1.5 g PVP powder was added and the agitation was continued for another 35 min. At the end of the mixing period the remaining acetone was decanted.\n",

The PVP solution was stirred with a magnetic bar and heated to 140 \u00b0C in a three-necked round bottom flask. Then the room temperature solutions of CuSO4 and ascorbic acid were simultaneously injected, drop-wise, into the hot PVP solution at a rate of approximately 0.25 ml min\u22121 by a syringe. Heating and stirring were maintained for a further hour and the solution finally turned reddish brown, it was then cooled to 80 \u00b0C and aged for approximately one hour in order to promote the growth of nanoparticles. It was necessary to add a further small amount of the ascorbic acid solution into the reaction mixture during this process to prevent the Cu nanocubes being oxidized. When the reaction finished, the reaction system was cooled to room temperature, then diluted with ethanol and centrifuged (2000 rpm, 15 min).\n",

N2H4 (Sigma-Aldrich, 35 wt%, 25 \u03bcL) was quickly injected into the above solution after stirring for 5 min. Upon addition of N2H4, the mixture initially turned white and cloudy, and changed to a clear and colorless solution within the first 2 min. The solution remained clear till t = ~60 min when a dark red color slowly appeared throughout the entire solution. An aqueous solution (~15 mL) containing 3% PVP (polyvinylpyrrolidone, Sigma-Aldrich, MW = 10 K) and 1% DEHA (diethylhydroxylamine, Acros Organics) was added to the growth solution to collect the nanowires. The mixture was then transferred to a separation funnel and vigorously shaken until a white clump of PVP and nanowires floated to the surface. The bottom solution was drained and fresh PVP/DEHA solution was added to re-disperse the nanowires. Seed solution was prepared by adding N2H4 (35%, 25 \u03bcL) into a preheated mixture (50 \u00b0C, stirred at 700 rpm) of Cu(NO3)2 (0.1 M, 1 mL), NaOH (15 M, 20 mL).

N2H4 (35 wt%, 25 \u03bcL) was then added, the stirring was stopped after 2 min, and the mixture slowly changed from orange to deep red over the next 20 min. A mixture of Cu(NO3)2 (0.1 M, 1 mL), NaOH (15 M, 20 mL) and a certain amount of EDA was preheated with stirring at 700 rpm for 5 min at 50 \u00b0C. After N2H4 (35%, 25 \u03bcL) was added, the solution turned orange and Cu2O octahedra formed. The Cu2O particles were collected using the PVP/DEHA solution and purified with 1% DEHA solution for further characterization with SEM and XRD.

In a typical synthesis, 10 mL of EG solution containing a small amount of PVP (MW= 55 000) (0.050 g) was stirred vigorously until all the PVP dissolved completely and the solution became transparent. Second, 0.02548 g of AgNO3 (~0.15 mmol) was dissolved in 5 mL of EG solution, followed by vigorous stirring until the solution became homogeneous. Finally, the two solutions were put into a 25-mL vial and mixed homogeneously by stirring, followed by placing the vial into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (50 mL capacity). The autoclave was heated in an oven and maintained at a temperature range of 80 to 180 \u00b0C for different times (30 min to a few hours) for optimization of products.\n",

Next, 0.6 mL of ice cold 0.1 M NaBH4 solution was added to the solution all at once while stirring. The particles in this solution were used as seeds within 2\u22125 h after preparation. In a clean test tube, 10 mL of growth solution, containing 2.5 \u00d7 10-4 M HAuCl4 and 0.1 M cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), was mixed with 0.05 mL of 0.1 M freshly prepared ascorbic acid solution. Next, 0.025 mL of the 3.5 nm seed solution was added. No further stirring or agitation was done. Within 5\u221210 min, the solution color changed to reddish brown. The solution was stable for more than one month. A three-step seeding method was used for this nanorod preparation. Three test tubes (labeled A, B, and C), each containing 9 mL growth solution, consisting of 2.5 \u00d7 10-4 M HAuCl4 and 0.1 M CTAB, were mixed with 0.05 mL of 0.1 M ascorbic acid. Next, 1.0 mL of the 3.5 nm seed solution was mixed with sample A. After 4\u22125 h, 1.0 mL was drawn from solution A and added to solution B, followed by thorough mixing. The color of solution B turned red within 4\u22125 min. After 4\u22125 h, 1 mL of B was mixed with C. Solution C turned red in color within 10 min. This procedure was similar to the method for preparing 13 aspect ratio rods. For 13 aspect ratio rods, the seed or solutions A and B were added to the growth solution after the growth occurring in the previous reaction was complete. But to make 18 aspect ratio rods, particles from A and B were transferred to the growth solution while the particles in these solution were still growing. Typically, solution A was transferred to B after 15 s of adding 3.5 nm seed to A, and solution B was transferred to C after 30 s of adding solution A to B.\n",
