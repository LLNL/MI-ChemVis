Briefly, a 20 mL aqueous solution containing 4 mL of 1% (w/w) trisodium citrate and 0.08 mL of 1% (w/w) tannic acid was rapidly added to an 80 mL aqueous solution containing 1 mL of 1% (w/w) hydrogen tetrachloroaurate(III) trihydrate after all were heated to 60 °C. Then the mixed solution was boiled for about 10 min under magnetic stirring. The solution was subsequently cooled to room temperature (RT) with chilled water. In brief, the AuNPs solution was mixed with an excess quantity of BSPP (with a final concentration of 0.2 mg/mL), and then shaken overnight. In a typical process, 1.0 mL AuNP solution was first washed carefully with water after centrifugation at 10 000 rpm (12 745g) for 6 min, then to the precipitate (ca. 1 μL) was added 10 μL of 4.0 mM NaCl aqueous solution before the addition of ethanol (100 μL), and finally the mixture was allowed to sit for 30 min.
