Palladium chloride (Kanto Chemicals) was used as purchased. H2PdCl4 aqueous solution (2.0 mM) was prepared by mixing 106.4 mg of PdCl2 (0.6 mmol), 6.0 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 294 mL of distilled water. A mixture of 15 mL of 2.0 mM H2PdCl4 aqueous solution (30 μmol of Pd), x mL of water, y mL of alcohol (x + y = 35 mL), and the designated amount of PVP was refluxed in a 100 mL flask for 3 h under air to synthesize the PVP-protected Pd nanoparticles (abbreviated as PVP−Pd). A second growth of PVP−Pd nanoparticles was carried out by mixing 25 mL of 0.6 mM PVP−Pd dispersion with 25 mL of a 0.6 mM H2PdCl4 in ethanol/water (2/3, v/v) solution, followed by refluxing the mixture for 3 h.
