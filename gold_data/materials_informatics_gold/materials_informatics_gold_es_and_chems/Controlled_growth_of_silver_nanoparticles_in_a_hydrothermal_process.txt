In a typical procedure, measured amounts of AgNO3 and PVP were separately dissolved in 30 mL water to prepare two aqueous solutions, as shown in Table 1. Ammonia was added dropwise to the aqueous solution of AgNO3 under magnetic stirring until a clear colorless solution was obtained, and then the above solution was mixed with the aqueous solution of PVP. After stirring for 1 h, the mixture was transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave, and the hydrothermal reaction was carried out at different temperature for 36 h. The resultant samples were vacuum-dried at room temperature.
