A 10 mM H2PdCl4 solution was prepared by completely dissolving 0.0178 g of PdCl2 powder in 10 mL of 20 mM HCl solution. Subsequently, 0.048 g of CTAC and 0.7 mL of 10 mM H2PdCl4 solution were added to each of the sample vials. The vials were kept in a water bath set at 35 °C throughout the particle synthesis. The vials were left undisturbed in the water bath for 15 min for halide ligand replacement reaction to complete. Next, 5 μL of 1.0 × 10–3 M KI solution was introduced, and the solution was left undisturbed for another 15 min. Finally, 120 μL of 0.05 M AA was added with thorough mixing, and the mixture was kept in the water bath for another 30 min to form Pd nanocrystals. The solution color turned light brown quickly within 30 s of introduction of AA and became dark brown in 30 min. First, 0.048 g of CTAC, 8.795 mL of deionized water, and 0.7 mL of 10 mM H2PdCl4 solution were mixed in a sample vial. The vial was kept in a water bath set at 60 °C. Then 50 μL of 1.0 × 10–3 M KBr solution was introduced, and the vial was left undisturbed for 15 min. Next, 5 μL of 1.0 × 10–3 M KI solution was introduced, and the solution was left undisturbed for another 15 min. After 450 μL of 0.05 M AA was added, the solution was thoroughly mixed. The mixture was kept in the water bath set at 60 °C for 30 min to form the concave cubes.
