In a typical synthesis, a 100 mL Au(III) solution (0.25 mM HAuCl4, 0.1 M CTAB) was combined with 1 mL AgNO3 solution (30 mM). To this was added 0.55 mL of ascorbic acid solution (0.1 M) and the flask was shaken continuously in order to induce stirring of the flask’s content (hand-stirred). Immediately, 0.5 mL of PNR seed solution (c = 1 mg/mL) was added and stirred. The solution was hand-stirred several times during the first few hours and the growth was allowed to continue for 24 h. A 10 mL Au(III) solution (0.25 mM HAuCl4, 0.1 M CTAB) was combined with 0.1 mL of AgNO3 solution (30 mM). To this was added 55 μL of ascorbic acid solution (0.1 M), and the mixture was hand-stirred rapidly. Immediately, 1 mL of nanowire solution (~0.5 mg nanowires) was added and stirred. The solution was hand-stirred several times during the first few hours, and the growth was allowed to continue for 24 h.
