First, 250 mL of a 0.15 wt % CMC aqueous solution was introduced into a 500 mL volumetric flask and gradually heated to 95 °C using a stirred/hot plate followed by the addition of 1000 μL of a 0.05 M Na2PdCl4·3H2O aqueous solution under stirring (700 rpm). Subsequently, 3000 μL of a 0.05 M l-ascorbic acid aqueous solution was added under constant stirring (700 rpm) and allowed to proceed for a reduction reaction at 95 °C for 5 min. Finally, the reaction system (i.e., volumetric flask) was moved from the hot stir plate to a room temperature (~23 °C) stir plate and then aged for about 24 h under stirring (300 rpm) prior to transmission electron microscopy characterization of these Pd nanoparticle seeds. After the Pd nanoparticle seeds were aged for 24 h, a seed-mediated growth process was performed. The Pd seeds were first mixed with a certain amount of Pd salt followed by a gradual addition of ascorbic acid solution. For the growth of 4.8 nm Pd nanoparticles, 360 μL of a 0.05 M Na2PdCl4·3H2O aqueous solution was added to 50 mL of the aqueous Pd nanoparticle seed dispersion in flask (I) and then stirred (700 rpm) for 3 h to allow a complete mixing of the Pd2+ with the Pd nanoparticle seeds at room temperature. Next, 1800 μL of a 0.03 M l-ascorbic acid aqueous solution was slowly added (dropwise) under stirring (700 rpm). In flask (II), for the growth of 6.2 nm Pd nanoparticles, 50 mL of the aqueous Pd nanoparticle seed dispersion was initially mixed with 1000 μL of a 0.05 M Na2PdCl4·3H2O aqueous solution and stirred (700 rpm) for 3 h. This was followed by slow addition (dropwise) of 5000 μL of a 0.03 M l-ascorbic acid aqueous solution under stirring (700 rpm) at room temperature. In flask (III), for the growth of 7.6 nm Pd nanoparticles, 50 mL of the aqueous Pd nanoparticle seed dispersion was mixed with 2040 μL of a 0.05 M Na2PdCl4·3H2O aqueous solution and stirred (700 rpm) for 3 h at room temperature. Subsequently, 10 200 μL of a 0.03 M l-ascorbic acid aqueous solution was slowly added (dropwise) under stirring (700 rpm). After the addition of the ascorbic acid solutions, the stirring speed was changed to 300 rpm where the growth systems were aged for 7 h. In the case of the CMC that had been heated to 95 °C, 250 mL of a 0.15 wt % CMC aqueous solution was introduced into a 500 mL volumetric flask and gradually heated to 95 °C using a stir/hot plate. After aging 5 min at 95 °C, the CMC solution in water was allowed to cool to room temperature.
