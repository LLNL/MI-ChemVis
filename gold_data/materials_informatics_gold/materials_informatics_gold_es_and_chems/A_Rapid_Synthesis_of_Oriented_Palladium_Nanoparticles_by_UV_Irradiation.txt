In a typical synthesis, a mixture of 20 mL of 5 mM PdCl2 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.9% purity) solution and 20 mL of 25 mM K2C2O4 (Merck, 99% purity) solution were stirred for 5 min. Formation of reddish yellow needles was observed. But, upon further dilution, the needles disappeared. Nitrogen gas was purged through reaction mixture for 5 min. Then, the mixture in a quartz tube was irradiated using 450 W Hg lamp (Oriel Corporation, USA) for 5 min in order to get the black precipitate.
