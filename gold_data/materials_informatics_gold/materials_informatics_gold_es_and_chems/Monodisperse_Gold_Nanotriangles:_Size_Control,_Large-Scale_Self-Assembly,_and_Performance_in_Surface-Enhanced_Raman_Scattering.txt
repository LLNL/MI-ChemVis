The initial seeds were prepared by the standard CTAC/NaBH4 procedure: 25 μL of a 0.05 M HAuCl4 solution was added to 4.7 mL of 0.1 M CTAC solution; 300 μL of a freshly prepared 0.01 M NaBH4 solution was then injected under vigorous stirring. Excess borohydride was consumed by keeping the seed solution for 2 h at room temperature prior to use. In a typical synthesis of 40 mL of a Au NT solution the following two growth solutions were prepared: (1) 1.6 mL of a 0.1 M CTAC solution was added to 8 mL of Milli-Q water, followed by 40 μL of 0.05 M HAuCl4 solution and 15 μL of a 0.01 M NaI solution; (2) 500 μL of a 0.05 M HAuCl4 solution was added to 40 mL of 0.05 M CTAC, followed by 300 μL of a 0.01 M NaI solution. Before proceeding, the initial seed@CTAC solution was diluted 10× in a 0.1 M CTAC solution. Subsequently, 40 and 400 μL of 0.1 M AA solution were added to solutions 1 and 2, respectively, and both solutions were manually stirred until the complete transparency of the solutions was achieved, indicating AuIII to AuI reduction. Finally, 100 μL of diluted seed@CTAC solution was added to solution 1 (and manually stirred for 1 s), and immediately 3.2 mL of this solution was added to solution 2 (and manually stirred for a few seconds). The Au NT dispersion was left undisturbed at room temperature for at least 1 h (see SI, Scheme S1, for a schematic representation of the synthetic protocol). We observed that addition of 15 μL of a 0.01 M NaI solution to solution 1 further improved the yield in NTs obtained with the fast addition procedure. Flocculation of the Au NTs was completed overnight, the supernatant was then removed, and the precipitated particles were redispersed in 5 mL of 0.1 M CTAC solution. The pellet was redispersed in 50 μL of a 0.1 M CTAC solution and sonicated briefly. Subsequently, water was added to reach a Au0 concentration of 0.5 mM. A 10 mg/mL PVP solution was prepared, sonicated for 10 min, and finally added under vigorous stirring to the Au NTs to achieve a final PVP concentration of 1 mg/mL. This solution was stirred overnight at room temperature.
