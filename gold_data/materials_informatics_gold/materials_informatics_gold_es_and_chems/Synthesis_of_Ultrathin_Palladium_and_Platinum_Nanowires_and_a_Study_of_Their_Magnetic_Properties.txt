A mixture of Pd(NO3)2 (Alfa Aesar, 99.95 %; 13 mg, 0.06 mmol) or PtCl2 (Alfa Aesar, 99.9 %; 16 mg, 0.06 mmol), ODA (Aldrich, 97 %; 0.4 g, 1.5 mmol), and DTAB (Aldrich, 98 %; 60 mg, 0.2 mmol) was dissolved in toluene (7 mL) by sonicating for 20 min under argon. Reduction was then performed by the dropwise addition of a freshly prepared solution of NaBH4 (Alfa Aesar, 99 %; 13 mg, 0.34 mmol) in 2 mL of distilled water. Stirring was stopped after one hour and then distilled water (2 mL) and chloroform (2 mL) were added to the solution.
