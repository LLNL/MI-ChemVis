In a typical synthesis, ethylene glycol (EG; 5 mL, J. T. Baker, 9300-01) was placed in a 20-mL vial, capped, and heated with stirring in an oil bath at 140 °C for 1 h. HCl (1 mL of a 3 mM solution in EG) was then quickly added, and the vial was recapped. After 10 min, AgNO3 (3 mL of a 94 mM solution in EG; Aldrich, 209 139–100G) and poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP; 3 mL of a solution in EG (147 mM in terms of the repeating unit); Mr≈55 000, Aldrich, 856568-100G) were simultaneously added with a two-channel syringe pump (KDS-200, Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL) at a rate of 45 mL per hour to the stirring solution. The vial was then capped and heated at 140 °C. For the scale-up synthesis, the vial was replaced with a 100-mL flask, and the volumes of all solutions were increased by a factor of five.
