This paper reports the synthesis of silver nanoparticles by chemical reduction of a very small volume (0.05 mL) of aqueous silver nitrate mixed with acetone into which solid PVP is added at 25 Â°C. Since PVP is insoluble in acetone, the original slightly yellow powder turns into a paste, whose color changes to dark brown after 35 min of magnetic agitation, indicating the formation of silver nanoparticles in the polymer matrix. The rest of the powder was dissolved in ethylene glycol under magnetic stirring. Therefore, 50 mg AgNO3 (29.4 mmol) were first dissolved in 0.05 mL de-ionized water. Then, 30 mL acetone was added and the resulting solution was mixed under magnetic agitation during 20 min. To this solution, 1.5 g PVP powder was added and the agitation was continued for another 35 min. At the end of the mixing period the remaining acetone was decanted.
