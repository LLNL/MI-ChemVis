A 10-mL volume of 1.0 mM silver nitrate was added dropwise (about 1 drop/second) to 30 mL of 2.0 mM sodium borohydride solution that had been chilled in an icebath. The reaction mixture was stirred vigorously on a magnetic stir plate. The solution turned light yellow after the addition of 2 mL of silver nitrate and a brighter yellow (Figure 1A) when all of the silver nitrate had been added. The entire addition took about three minutes, after which the stirring was stopped and the stir bar removed.
