Briefly, 10 ml of citrate-stabilised gold nanoparticles (seed crystals) were prepared by reduction of a 10 ml solution containing 0.25 mM [HAuCl4]·3H2O and 2.5 mM citric acid with 0.3 ml of ice cold aqueous 0.1 M NaBH4. 9 ml of an aqueous growth solution containing 0.1 M CTAB and 0.25 mM [HAuCl4]·3H2O were poured into each of four test-tubes. 50 μl of 0.1 M ascorbic acid, followed by 1 ml of the original solution containing the seed crystals, were added to one of the tubes (tube 1). The mixture was left for 24 h before similarly reducing the Au (III) solution in a second test-tube (tube 2) with ascorbic acid, and then adding 1 ml of the aged solution from tube 1. This procedure was then repeated after a further 24 h such that successive transfers of 1 ml of aged solutions into freshly reduced solutions proceeded from tube 2 to 3, and then from 3 to 4.
