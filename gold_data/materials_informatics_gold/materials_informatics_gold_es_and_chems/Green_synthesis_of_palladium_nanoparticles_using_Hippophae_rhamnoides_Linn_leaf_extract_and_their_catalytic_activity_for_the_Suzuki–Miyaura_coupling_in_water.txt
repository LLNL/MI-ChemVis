100 g of dried leaves powdered of sea buckthorn were kept into 1000-mL conical flask containing 500 mL hydroalcoholic solution (30% methanol), well mixed and then boiled for 30 min. The extract obtained was centrifuged in 6500 rpm then filtered through a filter paper and filtrate was kept at refrigerator to use further. Green synthesis of palladium nanoparticles using Hippophae rhamnoides Linn leaves extract. In a typical synthesis of Pd NPs, 10 mL extract of the plant leaves was added dropwise to 50 mL of 0.003 M aqueous solution of PdCl2 with constant stirring at 80 °C. The color of the reaction mixtures gradually changed from transparent yellow to dark brown in 25 min at 80 °C indicating the formation of palladium nanoparticles, then the colored solution of palladium nanoparticles was centrifuged at 7000 rpm for 30 min to completely dispersing. To a mixture of aryl iodide (1.0 mmol), phenylboronic acid (1.2 mmol), and potassium hydroxide (2.0 mmol), 10 mL of the Pd NPs solution (1.0 mol%) in water was added. The reaction mixture was then stirred at 100 °C for 12 h.
