In a typical synthesis, 15 mL of a 30 mM aqueous solution of Na2PdCl4 was mixed with 40 mL of a 50 mM TOAB solution in toluene. Then, 11.4 mL of a freshly prepared 0.1 M NaBH4 aqueous solution was slowly added, keeping the mixture under vigorous stirring. The mixture was gently stirred overnight and, after removing the water phase, the organic phase was washed with 40 mL of a 0.1 M H2SO4 solution, 40 mL of a 0.1 M NaOH solution, and finally three times with 40 mL of dionized water. To remove the remaining water, the organosol was finally dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. Palladium nanoparticle samples were obtained by mixing 40 mL of the organosol with 1 L of ethanol and kept for 24 h at −18 °C.
