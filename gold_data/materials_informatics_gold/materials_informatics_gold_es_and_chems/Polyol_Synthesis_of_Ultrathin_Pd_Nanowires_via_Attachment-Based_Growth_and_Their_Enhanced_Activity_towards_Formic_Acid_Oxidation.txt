In a standard synthesis, PVP (30 mg) and DEG (2 mL) were added into a glass vial and heated in an oil bath at 140 Â°C under magnetic stirring. Then, another DEG solution (1 mL) containing (CF3COO)2Pd (10 mg) was quickly injected with a pipette. The vial was removed from the oil bath 3 h later and naturally cooled down to room temperature.
