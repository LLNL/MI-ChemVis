To grow nanowires in our previous study, we kept the reaction mixture at a constant temperature (80 °C) throughout the nucleation and growth of the CuNWs. Furthermore, the capping agent used in the synthesis, ethylenediamine (EDA), was found to be a poor dispersant for the CuNWs. In order to grow longer, thinner wires, we heated the reaction mixture only a short time (about 3 min at 80 °C) in order to induce reduction of copper ions (as indicated from a change in the reaction color from blue to clear). Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) was then added to this mixture to prevent the CuNWs from aggregating and this mixture was quickly cooled in an ice bath.
