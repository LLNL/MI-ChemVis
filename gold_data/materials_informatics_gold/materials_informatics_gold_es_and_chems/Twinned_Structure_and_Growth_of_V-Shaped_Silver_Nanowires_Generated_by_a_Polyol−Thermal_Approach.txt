Ultrapure water was used in all the synthesis processes. In a typical synthesis, 10 mL of EG solution containing a small amount of PVP (MW= 55 000) (0.050 g) was stirred vigorously until all the PVP dissolved completely and the solution became transparent. Second, 0.02548 g of AgNO3 (~0.15 mmol) was dissolved in 5 mL of EG solution, followed by vigorous stirring until the solution became homogeneous. Finally, the two solutions were put into a 25-mL vial and mixed homogeneously by stirring, followed by placing the vial into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (50 mL capacity). The autoclave was heated in an oven and maintained at a temperature range of 80 to 180 Â°C for different times (30 min to a few hours) for optimization of products.
