For the preparation of all samples, freshly deionized H2O was employed. In a first step, 100 mL of a growth solution containing 0.1 M CTAB and 2.5 × 10−4 M H[AuCl4]·3H2O were prepared. This solution was kept at 33 °C for 24 h to completely dissolve the CTAB powder. Further, 20 mL of a seed solution containing small gold particles was prepared. This solution was kept undisturbed for 24 h at room temperature. After 24 h, 80 μL of a freshly prepared 0.1 M reducing agent solution (8.0 × 10−6 mol reducing agent) were added to 14.4 mL of the growth solution (containing 3.6 × 10−6 mol gold). The solution was mixed by shaking, whereupon it became colourless in the case of ascorbic acid (indication for the reduction of AuIII to AuI) and brighter yellow in the case of hydroquinone. The colour of the solution did not change for the other three used reducing agents. The addition of 16 μL of the seed solution (aged 24 h, containing 4.0 × 10−9 mol gold) and subsequent mixing of the solution by shaking led to a reddish colour of the solution. In some experiments, sodium hydroxide solution (e.g. 80 μL, 0.1 M, leading to a final pH around 4) was used to modify the pH value, added to the growth solution just before the addition of seed solution. In this case, after addition of the seed solution the reaction mixture became transparent for all reducing agents after a certain time (if not already transparent before addition of the seed solution).
