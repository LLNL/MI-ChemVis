The synthesis of 3 nm Pt NCs stabilized in CTAB was carried out following the method described by Grzelczak et al. A mixture of 9.63 mL of CTAB 0.1 M with 50 μL of K2PtCl4 0.05 M was heated up to 40 °C for 5 min until the solution became clear. After adding 0.3 mL of NaBH4 0.06 M, the vial was capped immediately. After 10 min, the vial was opened and stirred for several minutes until the decomposition of the NaBH4. The synthesis of Au NCs stabilized in CTAB were prepared via the method developed by Nikoobakht and El-Sayed. Briefly, 5 mL CTAB solution 0.2 M was mixed with 5 mL of HAuCl4 solution 0.0005 M. Next, 0.6 mL of freshly prepared NaBH4 0.01 M was added to the mixture while vigorously stirring, which resulted in the formation of a light-brown solution within few seconds. Stirring of the solution was continued for 2 min. Growth solution was prepared by mixing 5 mL of CTAB 0.2 M and 5 mL of HAuCl4 0.001 M. After that, 50 μL of AA 0.1 M was added as a mild reducing agent, changing the growth solution from dark yellow to colorless. Then, a volume between 5 and 30 μL of the presynthesized Pt seeds was added and gently mixed for 10 s. The solution was kept at RT without stirring for 1 month. Three different volumes (0.015, 0.15, and 1.5 mL) of K2PtCl4 solution 0.004 M were added to 5 mL CTAB solution 0.2 M. Then, 5 mL of HAuCl4 0.001 M and 55 μL of AA 0.1 M were added simultaneously to the solutions dropwise, and then gently mixed for 10 s. The final step was the addition of 12 μL of the presynthesized Au NC seed solution to the growth solutions. The solutions were kept at RT.
