First, 0.17 g of silver nitrate was dissolved in 20 ml of deionized water, followed by the stepwise addition of 1 M ammonia aqueous solution. After the ammonia was added, the transparent silver nitrate solution turned brown briefly, and as the amount of ammonia was increased, the mixture appeared transparent again. Subsequently, we added extra deionized water to render a 10 mM [Ag(NH3)2]+ solution. To form the desired silver nanoparticles, 25 ml of 10 mM [Ag(NH3)2]+ solution was properly mixed with 15 ml of 50 mM CTAB aqueous solution and 50 ml of glucose aqueous solution. The mixture was heated in an autoclave at 120 °C for 8 h and was allowed to cool to 25 °C afterwards.
