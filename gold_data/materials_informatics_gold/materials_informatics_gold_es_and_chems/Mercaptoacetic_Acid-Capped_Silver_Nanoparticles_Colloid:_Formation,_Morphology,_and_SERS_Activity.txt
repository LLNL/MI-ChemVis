A total of 2.5 mL of 10-2 M AgNO3 was added to 75 mL of triply distilled water. A total of 5 mL of 10-2 M mercaptoacetic acid was added as stabilizer to the solution with stirring. After 10 min of mixing, 2.5 mL of 10-2 M NaI was dropped into the solution slowly, yielding a green-yellow AgI colloid. A total of 20 mg of NaBH4 was added to the AgI colloidal solution, and the reaction mixture was continually stirred for about 20 min. The silver colloid was finally obtained.
