In a typical synthesis 2 ml of CTAB (10−2 M) solution was mixed with a stock HAuCl4 solution in an open mouth borosil glass vial (25 ml) in such an amount so that the final HAuCl4 concentration became 1.6 × 10−5 M. After that 1 ml (10−3 M) solution of aqueous 2-naphthol was added to the mixture and the final concentration of 2-naphthol in the mixture became 3.1 × 10−4 M. Finally 40 µl of 10−2 M NaOH was introduced rapidly with stirring to induce gold nanoparticle nucleation and then the mixture was irradiated under a ~365 nm UV light for about 17 h. The irradiation was done keeping the UV light source 3 cm apart from the open end of the glass vials.
