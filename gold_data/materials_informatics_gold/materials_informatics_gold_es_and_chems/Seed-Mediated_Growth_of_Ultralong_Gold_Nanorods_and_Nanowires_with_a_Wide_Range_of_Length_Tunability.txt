A volume of 10 mL of aqueous solution containing 0.25 mM HAuCl4 and 0.10 M CTAB was prepared in a 20 mL vial. Concurrently, 10 mL of 0.02 M ice-cold NaBH4 was freshly made. Then 450 μL of the NaBH4 solution was introduced into the CTAB–HAuCl4 solution while stirring vigorously. After stirring for 5 min, the solution was kept undisturbed for 2 h at 27 °C to decompose excess borohydride by water. First, two 25 mL flasks and one 50 mL conical flask were labeled A, B, and C. For samples a–f, or series I samples (see Table S1 in the Supporting Information), 1.9681 g of CTAB, deionized water (52.569 mL for sample a, 52.596 mL for samples b and e, 52.623 mL for samples c and d, and 52.542 mL for sample f), and 1.35 mL of 0.01 M HAuCl4 solution were mixed. Next, various amounts of NaOH or HNO3 solution were added to the mixture (81, 54, and 27 μL of 0.5 M NaOH solution for samples a, b, and c and 27, 54, and 108 μL of 0.5 M HNO3 solution for samples d, e, and f, respectively). At this point, the total solution volume is 54 mL. CTAB and HAuCl4 concentrations in the growth solution are, respectively, 0.1 M and 0.25 mM excluding the volume of ascorbic acid. Then 4.5 mL of the growth solution was added to flasks A and B and 45 mL to flask C. Finally, 25, 25, and 250 μL of 0.1 M ascorbic acid were, respectively, introduced into flasks A, B, and C. The flasks were gently shaken until the solutions became colorless. Here a mixture of 1.093 g of CTAB, 29.475 mL of deionized water, and 525 μL of 0.01 M HAuCl4 solution was made first. A volume of 2.5 mL of the solution was transferred to flasks A and B and 25 mL to flask C. CTAB and HAuCl4 concentrations in the growth solution are, respectively, 0.1 M and 0.175 mM excluding the volume of nitric acid and ascorbic acid. Subsequently, 0.5 M HNO3 solution was added to flask C only (0.0504, 0.252, 0.550, 1.1, and 3.0 mL of HNO3 solution for samples g, h, i, j, and k and 0.0504, 0.252, 1.1, 3.0, and 5.0 mL of HNO3 solution for samples l, m, n, o, and p, respectively). Finally, 10, 10, and 100 μL of 0.1 M ascorbic acid solution was introduced into flasks A, B, and C, respectively. For series I, II, and III samples, 400, 200, and 200 μL of the gold seed solution was, respectively, added to flask A and shaken slightly for 10 s. Immediately 400 (series I) and 200 μL (series II and III) of the solution in flask A was transferred to flask B and shaken for 10 s. Finally, 4 mL (series I), 2 mL (series II), and 200 μL (series III) of the solution in flask B was transferred to flask C and shaken for 5 s. Flask C was left undisturbed for 12 h for completion of nanorod and nanowire growth.
