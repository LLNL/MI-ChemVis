To prepare feed precursor solutions for a typical synthesizing CuNWs, 0.5 mM CuCl2·2H2O (in ethanol solvent), and 0.5 mM long-chain poly-vinylpyrrolidone (PVP, Mw = 60[thin space (1/6-em)]000, in ethanol solvent) were, simultaneously, injected dropwise into a round-bottom flask which was magnetically stirred at a rate of 45 mL h−1. Then the precursor solution was pre-heated for 3 min and flowed through a continuous flow reactor (CFR, Scheme 1) using a low flow peristaltic pump at a total rate of 5.0 mL min−1 under refluxing conditions at 80 °C, while hydrazine monohydrate (50% vol. in ethanol) was prepared in a separate flask with the appropriate feed lines inserted, such that the final concentration of the precursor solution in the reaction column would be persisted unchanged.
