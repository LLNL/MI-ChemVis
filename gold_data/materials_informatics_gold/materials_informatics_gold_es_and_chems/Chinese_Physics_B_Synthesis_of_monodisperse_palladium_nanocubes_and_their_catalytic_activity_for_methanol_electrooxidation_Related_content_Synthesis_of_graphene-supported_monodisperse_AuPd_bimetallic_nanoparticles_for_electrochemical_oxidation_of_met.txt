In a 50-mL flask, 0.0120 g of PVP and 0.200 g of KBr were dissolved in 10-mL EG, and then heated in air under magnetic stirring at 150 ◦C for 1 h. The palladium precursor was prepared in another vessel by dissolving 0.0371 g of Na2PdCl4 in a mixed solution of 1-mL water and 4-mL EG. This solution was injected into the flask using a syringe pump at a rate of 20 mL per hour. The reaction mixture was then heated up to 150 ◦C in air and kept at this temperature for 1 h.
