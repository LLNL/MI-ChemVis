Prior to anodizing, high-purity aluminum foils (99.999%) were annealed at 500 °C for 2 h in vacuum, then degreased in acetone. Anodization was carried out for 2 h with 1 M H2SO4 to form the holes. After removing the alumina layer formed at the above step in a mixture of phosphoric acid (6 wt%) and chromic acid (1.8 wt%), the aluminum foils were anodized again at the same condition as the first step for 5 h, then the AAO templates were etched by saturated SnCl4 solution to remove the remaining aluminum. The AAO templates were etched treatment carried out in a 5 wt% phosphoric acid solution at 25 °C for 20 min to remove the barrier layer on the bottom side of the AAO. Electro-deposition was carried out in an aqueous solution containing 0.5 g L−1 Pd(NH3)4Cl2 and 0.8 g L−1 Na2EDTA to prepare Pd nanowire arrays. The pH value of the solution was adjusted to 8.5 with NH3 · H2O. The Pd nanowire arrays electrode was prepared using the potential of −0.6 V for 40 min under stirring. All of the solutions were prepared by using distilled water and were purged with Ar before experiment. The Pd nanowire arrays embedded in AAO were lastly dipped into 2 M NaOH solution for 1 h to remove the AAO completely and washed by distilled water several times. The PTFE, Pt loading on electrode was 0.24 mg cm−2. A standard three-electrode cell was used and was controlled at 25 °C using a water bath during the experiment.
