The reduction of a gold hydrochlorate solution (Chempur, 99%) has been initiated by sodium tris-citrate (Merck) by bringing gold solution to a boil in a double-walled reactor, which is heated by a bath thermostat. No refluxing was utilized in order to prevent the presence of temperature gradients in the liquid. When the solution (95 mL) started to boil, 5 mL of preheated citrate solution was added. After a defined time (normally 15 min), the liquid was extracted and cooled to room temperature.
