The collected fresh BL (5 g) was washed thoroughly with Milli-Q water; heated (65–70 °C) in 50 mL of Milli-Q water for 60 min. The filtrate was collected in a 50 mL Erlenmeyer flask and stored at 4 °C for further use. For green synthesis, 1.0 mL of BL extract was mixed with 10 mL of 1 mM K2PdCl6 solution; (a) kept at 25 °C for 24 h and then (b) agitated under sonication. Ultrasound irradiation was carried out with ultrasonic processors (DAIGGER GE 505, 500 W, 20 kHz) immersed directly into the reaction solution. After ultrasound irradiation, reduction of Pd2+ to Pd was observed by the change in their color (yellow to brownish-black) of the reaction mixture. In set 1, 5 mL of MB (10 mg/L) and 1 mL of H2O were kept in a glass vial. In set 2, 5 mL of MB (10 mg/L) was mixed with 700 μL of H2O and 300 μL of PdNPs. In set 3, 5 mL of MB (10 mg/L) was mixed with 700 μL of H2O and 300 μL of PdNPs, and then kept in visible light (55–60 cd/m2) at room temperature.
