CuCl2·2H2O (6.8 g, ~40 mmol) and glucose (7.92 g, ~40 mmol) were added to a 900 mL beaker containing 800 mL of H2O under magnetic sirring. Then, 80 mL of OM, 0.8 mL of OA, and 140 mL of ethanol were loaded to a 400 mL beaker under magnetic stirring. Afterward, these two solutions were put into a 5 L plastic container and diluted to 4000 mL with water, followed by magnetic stirring for 12 h on a 50 °C hot plate. Subsequently, the mixture was transferred to a 5 L electric pressure cooker. The reaction temperature was held for 2–12 h. Finally, the reddish brown CuNWs were obtained.
