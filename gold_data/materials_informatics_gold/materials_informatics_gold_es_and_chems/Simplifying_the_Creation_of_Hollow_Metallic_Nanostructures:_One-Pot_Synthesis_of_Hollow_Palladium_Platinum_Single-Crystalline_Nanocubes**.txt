In a typical synthesis of palladium nanocubes, palladium acetylacetonate ([Pd(acac)2]), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), and an aqueous solution of sodium iodide (NaI) were mixed together with DMF (see the Experimental Section). The resulting homogeneous solution was transferred to a teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave. The sealed vessel was then heated at 150 °C for 8 h. The purified palladium nanocubes were then reacted with [Pt(acac)2] for eight hours in a DMF solution of PVP containing different halides. Synthesis of Pd multiply twinned nanoparticles: Pd(II)acetylacetonate ([Pd(acac)2], 50.0 mg), PVP (160.0 mg), and water (2 mL) were mixed together in DMF (10 mL). The resulting homogeneous yellow solution was transferred to a teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave. The sealed vessel was then heated at 150 °C for 8 h before it was cooled to room temperature. Synthesis of palladium nanocubes: [Pd(acac)2] (50.0 mg), PVP (160.0 mg), and an NaI solution (2 mL, 0.15 g mL−1) were mixed together in DMF (10 mL). Synthesis of hollow palladium/platinum nanocubes: [Pd(acac)2] (25.0 mg), [Pt(acac)2] (30.0 mg), PVP (160.0 mg), and an NaI solution (2 mL, 0.15 g mL−1) were mixed together in DMF (10 mL). The resulting solution was transferred to a teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave. The sealed vessel was then heated at 150 °C for the desired time before it was cooled to room temperature. Synthesis of solid palladium/platinum nanocubes: PdCl2 (13.3 mg), PtCl2 (20.0 mg), PVP (160.0 mg), and an NaI solution (2 mL, 0.15 g mL−1) were mixed together in DMF (10 mL). The resulting homogeneous brown solution was then sealed and heated at 150 °C for 8 h to yield the solid nanocubes.
