A quantity of 3 mL of an aqueous solution of 0.08 M hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and 0.42 mg/mL tetradodecylammonium bromide was used as the growth solution. Hydrogen tetracholoaurate (0.25 mL of 0.024 M, HAuCl4·3H2O, Alfa Aeser) was added to the solution as the precursor of gold, and 0.065 mL of acetone and 0.045 mL of cyclohexane were added to loosen the micellar structure. Different amounts of 0.01 M silver nitrate (AgNO3) aqueous solution were added to the solution. The solution was irradiated with a 254-nm UV light (420 μW/cm2) for about 30 h.
