Typically, 0.170 g of AgNO3 is dissolved in 10 mL of EG under magnetic stirring. Then, 0.15 M of PVP-40 and 0.111 mM of CuCl2·2H2O mixed solution in 10 mL of EG is added dropwise to the above solution. Afterwards, the mixture is transferred into Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave with a capacity of 50 mL and heated at 160 °C for 3 h.
