K2PdCl4 was reduced by ascorbic acid in the presence of CTAB and trisodium citrate. A “stock” solution was made by mixing aqueous solutions of K2PdCl4 and CTAB. Upon mixing, the solution changed color from light yellow to orange. K2PdCl4 was reduced by ascorbic acid in the presence of CTAB and trisodium citrate. A “stock” solution was made by mixing aqueous solutions of K2PdCl4 and CTAB. Upon mixing, the solution changed color from light yellow to orange. The stock solution consisted of 2.5 × 10-4 M K2PdCl4 and 8 × 10-3 M CTAB in water. Six clean centrifuge tubes containing different amounts of trisodium citrate dihydrate were labeled A, B, C, D, E, and F. Into each tube we placed 45 mL of the stock solution, which dissolved trisodium citrate completely in a few seconds. Then 250 μL of 0.1 M freshly prepared ascorbic acid aqueous solution was added to each of the six tubes.
