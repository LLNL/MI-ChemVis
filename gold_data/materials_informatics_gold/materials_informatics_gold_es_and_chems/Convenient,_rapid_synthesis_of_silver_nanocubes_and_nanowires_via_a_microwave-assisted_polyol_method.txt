In the synthesis of silver nanocubes, hydrochloric acid (HCl) is added to the solution; also the rate of AgNO3 solution addition is controlled. In a typical procedure, a 10 ml EG solution of Na2S was vigorously stirred after the addition of 0.075 M PVP. Then this mixed solution was injected drop by drop using a syringe into 10 ml of a magnetically stirred EG solution of AgNO3 (0.05 M). Afterward, the solutions were transferred to a microwave oven operating at 2.45 GHz and heated. Upon completion of the reaction, the solutions were allowed to cool down in air.
