A 40 ml EG solution of NaCl with different concentrations (0.2 and 20 mM) was vigorously stirred after the addition of 1.776 g of PVP. The mixed solution was injected drop by drop using a syringe into 40 ml of a magnetically stirred EG solution of AgNO3 (0.1 M) for 5 min. Afterwards, the solution was put into four separate 25 ml Teflon-lined autoclave tubes. The tubes were sealed and maintained at 160 Â°C for different periods of time, followed by natural cooling to room temperature.
