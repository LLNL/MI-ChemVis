Then, a 0.5% (w/v) of homogenous gum stock solution was prepared in ultrapure water by stirring overnight at room temperature. Then, this solution was centrifuged (5500×g, 10 min) to remove the insoluble materials and the supernatant was used for synthesis. The palladium nanoparticles were synthesized by autoclaving the gum solutions containing PdCl2 at 121 °C and 103 kPa for 30 min.
