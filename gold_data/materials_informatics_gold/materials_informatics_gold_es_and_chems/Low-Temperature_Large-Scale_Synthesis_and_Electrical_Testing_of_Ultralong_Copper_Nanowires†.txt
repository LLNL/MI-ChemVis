In the course of a typical preparation procedure, copper chloride (0.17 g, 12.5 mM) and glucose (0.391 g, ~2 mmol) were dissolved in 80 mL of distilled water in an Erlenmeyer flask. Then hexadecylamine (1.44 g) was slowly added to the water solution followed by vigorous mixing for 5 h by magnetic stirrer until a light blue emulsion was obtained. The emulsion was placed in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave of 200 mL capacity. The autoclave was rotated at 393 K for 2 h under autogenous pressure and then allowed to cool to room temperature.
