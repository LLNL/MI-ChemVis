The palladium nitrate solution was prepared by dissolving 1.25 mg of Pd(NO3)2 in 30 mL of deionized water. A mixture of 40 mL of ethylene glycol and 5 Ã— 10-6 mol (0.2 g) of PVP was mixed under magnetic stirring in a glass vessel for 15 min. The covered vessel was fixed and irradiated with ultrasonic waves, necessary for the nitrate reduction, for 180 min using a multiwave ultrasonic generator (50 kHz).
