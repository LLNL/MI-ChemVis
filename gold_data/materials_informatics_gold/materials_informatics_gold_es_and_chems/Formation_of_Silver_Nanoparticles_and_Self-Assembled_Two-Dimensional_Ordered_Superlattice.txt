Thirty milliliters of an aqueous silver ion solution (0.03 M AgNO3) was mixed with 20 mL of a chloroformic solution of phase transfer catalyst (0.20 M (C8H17)4NBr) and stirred vigorously for 1 h. The French gray organic phase was subsequently collected, and 150 Î¼L 1-nonanethiol was added. After the nonanethiol/Ag+ solution was stirred for 15 min, 24 mL of fresh aqueous sodium borohydride (0.43 M NaBH4) solution used as the reducing agent was injected, and the system color became sable immediately. The reaction mixture was stirred for over 3 h before the organic/nanocrystal-rich phase was collected.
