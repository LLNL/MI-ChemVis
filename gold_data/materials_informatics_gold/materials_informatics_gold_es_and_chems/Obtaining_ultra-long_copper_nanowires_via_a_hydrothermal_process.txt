In a typical process for synthesizing copper nanowires, 2 mmol octadecylamine (ODA) was added to 80 mL of copper (II) chloride (12.5 mmol L-1) aqueous solution and vigorously stirred for 5 h forming a blue emulsion.  Then the solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave of 100-mL capacity and heated at 120–180 °C for 48 h. After the autoclave was cooled down to room temperature naturally, the supernatant was decanted and the final product was obtained after washing the solid part with n-hexane, deionized water and ethanol, respectively.
