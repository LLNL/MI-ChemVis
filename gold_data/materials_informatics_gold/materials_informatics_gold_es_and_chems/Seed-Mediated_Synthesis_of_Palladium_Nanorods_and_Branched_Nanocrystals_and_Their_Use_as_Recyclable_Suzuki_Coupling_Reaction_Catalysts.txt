First, a 2.0 mM PdCl42− solution was prepared by dissolving 0.0355 g of deep brown PdCl2 powder (Aldrich, 99%) and 0.876 g of NaCl in 100 mL of deionized water. In a round-bottom flask, 10 mL of 2.5 × 10−4 M PdCl42− aqueous solution, prepared by diluting the 2.0 mM PdCl42− solution, was bubbled with nitrogen for 30 min to remove the dissolved oxygen and prevent reoxidation of the initially formed seed particles. The bubbled solution was injected into a two-neck flask containing 0.3645 g (1 mmol) of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) surfactant (Alfa Aesar, 98%) and stirred until the CTAB powder was dissolved. Concurrently, 10 mL of ice-cold 0.015 M NaBH4 (Aldrich, 98%) solution was prepared in another flask. Next, 220 μL of the NaBH4 aqueous solution was injected into the solution in the two-neck flask. This solution must be kept under nitrogen to avoid exposure to air. Two 20 mL vials labeled A and B were used. The growth solution was prepared by adding 0.345 g of CTAB powder and 10 mL of 2.5 × 10−4 M PdCl42− solution into both of these vials and stirred until the CTAB powder was completely dissolved. Then 78 μL of 0.1 M l-(+)-ascorbic acid (Riedel-de-Haën, 99.7%) was added as a reducing agent into vial A. Next, 84 μL of the seed solution was transferred into vial A, and the vial was shaken for 5 s. After 2 h, the solution in vial A turned blackish green. At this time, 100 μL of 4.0 × 10−3 M copper(II) acetate (J.T. Baker, 98%) solution was added to vial B, followed by the addition of 78 μL of 0.1 M l-(+)-ascorbic acid. A volume of 84 μL of the blackish green solution in vial A was withdrawn and added to vial B. Again, this vial was shaken for 5 s. The mixture was left undisturbed at 30 °C for 20 h, and the solution turned dark brown.
