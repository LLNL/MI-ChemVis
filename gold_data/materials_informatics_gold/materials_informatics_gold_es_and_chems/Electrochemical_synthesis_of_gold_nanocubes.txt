The surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (C19H42BrN; CTAB, 98%, Fluka) (0.08 M) served as the electrolytic growth solution, of which 3 mL was put in the glass test tube. Then, 25.2 mg of powdered auxiliary surfactant tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide (C48H100BrN; TTAB, 99%, Fluka) was added to the same test tube, where it floated on the growth solution. A pipette was then used to add 0.95 mL of acetone (99%, J. T. Baker) solvent on the top of the solution, after which the test tube was sonicated at 40 kHz for 5 min. Electrolysis was carried out under constant ultrasonication (ELMA T710DH, Germany) at 40 kHz for 5 min. During the electrolysis, the acetone solvent was simultaneously injected into the growth solution at a rate of 0.125 mL min− 1. The typical current was set to 5 mA, and the temperature was held constant at 36 °C.
