10 mM [Ag(NH3)2]OH solution was prepared by adding ammonia into an aqueous solution of AgNO3 (0.17 g) until the solution turned from brown to transparent and then some more deionized water was added to obtain a total volume of 20 mL. Then, 5 ml [Ag(NH3)2]OH, 3 ml CTAB (20 mM), and 10 ml aqueous glucose (7.5 mM) solution were sequentially mixed and transferred to a 25 ml autoclave, sealed and maintained at 120 °C for 8 h. After the autoclave was cooled to room temperature naturally, the resulting precipitates were separated and washed three times by centrifugation. The above synthesized Ag NPs were added into a solution containing 25 mL of water, 15 mL of ethanol, 75 mg of CTAB and 0.25 mL of aqueous solution of ammonia. After being agitated ultrasonically for 30 min, 120 μL of TEOS was added dropwise into the solution with continuous stirring for about 10 seconds and the reaction was continued for 1 h. The particles were collected by centrifugation and washed with ethanol and water, respectively. The CTAB surfactant was removed by dissolving the sample in acetone for 6 h to form the mesoporous shell. 0.1 g AgNO3 was first dissolved into a mixed solution of water and ammonia (water 2 mL, ammonia 0.2 mL), and 1 g PVP was added into 13 mL Ag@MSiO2 (2 M) ethanol solution. The above two solutions were then mixed together and fully dispersed under magnetic stirring. After that, the mixed solution was transferred to a 20 mL autoclave, sealed and maintained at 120 °C for 12 h.
