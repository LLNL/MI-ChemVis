10 mM [Ag(NH3)2]OH solution was prepared by adding ammonia into aqueous solution of AgNO3 (0.17 g) until the solution turned from brown to transparent and then extra deionized water were added to form a total volume of 20 mL. Then, 5 mL [Ag(NH3)2]OH, 5 mL CTAB (50 mM), and 10 mL glucose (1.5 or 1 mM) aqueous solution was sequentially mixed and transferred to a 25 mL autoclave, sealed and maintained at 120 °C for 8 h. The 75 nm silver NCs were prepared by lengthening the hydrothermal time for the precursor solution with 1 mM glucose to 12 h. In order to obtain further larger silver NCs, a secondary growth method was applied. In a standard synthesis, 5 mL the as-prepared 65 nm silver NCs, 5 mL [Ag(NH3)2]OH, 5 mL CTAB (50 mM), and 10 mL glucose (1 mM) in aqueous solutions were mixed together as the precursor solution. Then the mixture solution was transferred to a 30 mL autoclave, sealed and maintained at 120 °C for 8 h. The 105 nm silver NCs were finally obtained. R6G or 4MBA-labeled silver NCs were prepared as follow: 20 μL of R6G or 4MBA (1 mM) ethanol solution was added to 5 mL of the purified silver NCs solution under stirring and agitated for 12 h at room temperature.
