The procedure is briefly described as follows: 10 ml ethylene glycol (EG) was refluxed in a three-necked flask at ~170° for about 2 h, and then 3 ml EG solution of H2PtCl6 (0.1 mM) was added quickly. After reaction for 5 min, 12 ml of an EG solution of an AgNO3 (0.05 M) and PVP (0.1 M) mixture was added into the refluxing solution drop by drop. When the addition ended, the reaction solution was further heated at ~170° for about 1 h. The 12 ml EG solution of the AgNO3 (0.05 M) and PVP (0.1 M) mixture was rapidly added into the refluxing EG solution at ~170° and allowed to react for 1 h under the same conditions.
