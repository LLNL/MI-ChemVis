In order to stabilize the Pd nanoparticles, approximately 1.0 mM CTAB was added in solutions. The molar ratio of precursor to reducing agent was maintained at 1:4 and 1:8. The flow rate of precursor and reducing agent was maintained at 30 and 50 mL/h for two different experimental runs. The microreactor was immersed in a temperature-controlled water bath to maintain the temperature at 25 Â°C. Finally, Pd colloidal suspension was formed in dark brown in color.
