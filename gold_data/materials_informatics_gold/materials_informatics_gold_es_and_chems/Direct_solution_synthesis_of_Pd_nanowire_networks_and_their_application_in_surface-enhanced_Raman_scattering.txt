In a typical synthesis, 0.0224 g Pd(CH3CO)2 (Aldrich) was introduced into 2 ml of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and 23 ml of ethylene glycol (EG) in a three-necked flask equipped with a reflux condenser and a magnetic Teflon-coated stirrer at room temperature. The reaction mixture was slowly heated to 120 °C and held in air for 3 h. After being cooled down to room temperature, the products were centrifuged, washed with distilled water and then with ethanol for several times to remove any excess EG and DMSO and finally dried in vacuum at 60 °C.
