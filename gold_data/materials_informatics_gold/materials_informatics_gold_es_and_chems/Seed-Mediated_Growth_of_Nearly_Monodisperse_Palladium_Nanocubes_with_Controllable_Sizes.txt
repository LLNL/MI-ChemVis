A ten millimolar H2PdCl4 solution was prepared by dissolving 0.1773 g of PdCl2 in 10 mL of 0.2 M HCl and further diluting to 100 mL with double distilled water. 0.5 mL of 10 mM H2PdCl4 solution was added to 10 mL of 12.5 mM CTAB solution under stirring, and then the solution was heated at 95 °C for 5 min before 80 μL of freshly prepared 100 mM ascorbic acid solution was added. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min. 125 μL of 10 mM H2PdCl4 solution was added to 5 mL of 50 mM CTAB solution kept at 40 °C, different volumes (400 μL for 37 nm, 200 μL for 44 nm, 80 μL for 56 nm, 40 μL for 76 nm, 10 μL for 109 nm nanocubes) of the as-synthesized 22 nm Pd nanocubes solution were added, and then 25 μL of freshly prepared 100 mM ascorbic acid solution was added and mixed thoroughly. The resulting solution was placed in a water bath at 40 °C. The reactions were stopped after 14 h by centrifuging (12000 rpm, 10 min). All procedures were the same as those described for seed-mediated growth of bigger Pd nanocubes except that 80 μL of CTAC-capped Pd seed solution was added as seeds and CTAC solution was used instead of CTAB solution. The reduction process was rather fast and the color of the solution turned brownish yellow within 30 s. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min.
