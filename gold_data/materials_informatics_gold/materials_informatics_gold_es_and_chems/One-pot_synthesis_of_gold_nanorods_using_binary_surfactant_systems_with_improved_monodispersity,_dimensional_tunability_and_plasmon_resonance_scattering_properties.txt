In a typical synthesis, 140 mg (37 mM in the final growth solution) of CTAB and 31 mg (9.9 mM in the final growth solution) of NaOL were dissolved in 5 ml of warm water (~50 °C). The solution was allowed to cool down to 30 °C and 5 ml HAuCl4 (1 mM) solution was added. The solution became colorless after 5 min of ultrasonication. Following this, 250 μl AgNO3 (4 mM) solution was added, and the mixture was gently shaken. 50 μl HCl (37 wt% in water, 12 M) was introduced to adjust the pH value to ~1.5. Then, 15 μl of freshly prepared AA (100 mM) was added to the solution. The mixture was ultrasonicated for around 5 min until it achieved homogeneous mixing. Finally, 1 μl ice-cold NaBH4 (10 mM) was injected into the unstirred solution and allowed to react for 6 h.
