The procedure is briefly described as follows: a 10 mL EG solution with different concentrations of Na2S was vigorously stirred after the addition of 0.15 M PVP. This mixed solution was injected dropwise into 10 mL EG solution of AgNO3 (0.1 M) under magnetically stirring. Afterwards, the mixture was transferred into a 25 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and kept at different temperatures for 1.5 h. When the reaction was finished, the autoclave was natural cooled to the room temperature.
