The seeds were synthesized according to our method reported previously. Typically this involves the preparation of a 20 mL aqueous solution containing 2.5 × 10-4 M HAuCl4 and 2.5 × 10-4 M trisodium citrate. To this solution was added 0.6 mL of ice cold 0.1 M NaBH4 with stirring. The seed particles were stored at 25 °C for 3 h prior to any further experimentation, to allow excess borohydride to be decomposed by water. A 10 mL sample of the citrate-stabilized seed solution (the 3.5 nm seed solution mentioned above in (a)), aged after 3 h of synthesis, was taken in a conical flask. Next, to this was added 250 μL of a 10-2 M ethanolic solution of 4-MBA with stirring. Typically, 18 mL of an aqueous solution of 2.5 × 10-4 M HAuCl4 was prepared in a conical flask. To this solution was added 2 mL of 1 M D-glucose. The solution was heated to 60 °C, 40 μL of 1 M NaOH was added, and the resulting solution was subsequently stirred rapidly for 10 s. The seed solution was cooled to room temperature and used directly for all further experiments. Specifically, 100 mL of an aqueous solution of 2.5 × 10-4 M HAuCl4 was heated to boiling. To this was added 10 mL of an aqueous solution of 1% sodium citrate, and boiling was continued. Next, a growth solution was prepared wherein 100 mL of an aqueous solution of 2.5 × 10-4 M HAuCl4 was taken in a conical flask. To this was added 3 g of solid CTAB (0.08 M final CTAB concentration), and the resulting solution was heated with stirring. The solution was cooled to room temperature and used as a stock solution.  A 7.5 mL aliquot of the growth solution was mixed with 50 μL of freshly prepared 0.1 M ascorbic acid solution. Next, 2.5 mL of the 3.5 nm seed solution was added with stirring. Stirring was continued for a further 10 min for complete reduction of the gold salt. A 9 mL sample of the growth solution and 50 μL of 0.1 M ascorbic acid solution were mixed, and 1.0 mL of the 3.5 nm seed solution was added with vigorous stirring. Stirring was continued for an additional 10 min. The final color of the solution was dark red, and the particles prepared by this method were 8.0 ± 0.8 nm. A 9 mL sample of the growth solution was mixed with 50 μL of 0.1 M ascorbic acid solution, and 1.0 mL of the 8.0 nm seed solution (as synthesized above) was added with vigorous stirring. Specifically, to a 10 mL 0.1 M aqueous solution of CTAB was added 250 μL of 0.01 M HAuCl4. To the stirred solution was added 0.60 mL of 0.01 M sodium borohydride, which resulted in the formation of a brown-yellow solution. Vigorous stirring of the seed solution, which was kept at 25 °C, was continued for 2 min. This seed solution was further used for the synthesis of gold nanorods after 30 min of its synthesis. Gold nanorods were synthesized by the three-step seeding protocol as described previously. Specifically, two 20 mL conical flasks and one 100 mL conical flask (labeled A, B, and C, respectively) were taken. To these flasks were added 9 mL (in flasks A and B) and 45 mL (in flask C) of growth solution containing a mixture of 2.5 × 10-4 M HAuCl4 and 0.1 M CTAB solutions. To these solutions were added 50 μL (flasks A and B) and 250 μL (flask C) of 0.1 M freshly prepared ascorbic acid, and the resulting solutions were stirred gently. The orange color of the gold salt in the CTAB solution disappeared when ascorbic acid was added. After 15 s, 1.0 mL of sample A was mixed with sample B (step 2). A 5.0 mL portion of sample B was further added to sample C after 30 s (step 3). In all cases, each flask was gently stirred to homogenize the solutions. The solution in flask C was kept at 25 °C for a period of 16 h.
