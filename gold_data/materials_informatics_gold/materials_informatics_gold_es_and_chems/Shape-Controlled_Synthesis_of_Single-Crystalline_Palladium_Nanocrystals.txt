A 10 mM H2PdCl4 solution was prepared by dissolving 0.1773 g of PdCl2 in 10 mL of 0.2 M HCl solution and further diluting to 100 mL with doubly distilled water.In a typical synthesis, a 1 mL aliquot of 10 mM H2PdCl4 solution was added to 20 mL of 12.5 mM CTAB solution heated at 95 °C under stirring. After 5 min, 160 μL of freshly prepared 100 mM ascorbic acid solution was added, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 20 min.

After 5 min, 160 μL of freshly prepared 100 mM ascorbic acid solution was added, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 20 min. In a typical synthesis, a given amount of KI solutions were added to 5 mL of 100 mM CTAB solution kept at a given temperature. A 125 μL portion of 10 mM H2PdCl4 solution and 40 μL of the as-synthesized seed palladium nanocubes solution were then added. Finally, 50 μL of freshly prepared 100 mM ascorbic acid solution was added, and the solution was mixed thoroughly. The resulting solution was placed in a water bath at designated temperatures.
