In a typical synthesis of copper nanoparticles, 50 ml aqueous solution of 0.4 M L-ascorbic acid (reagent grade, fine crystal, Fisher Scientific) and 0.8 M Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) (in repeating unit, weight-average molecular weight of 58,000, Acros Organics) was directly mixed with another 50 ml aqueous solution of 0.01 M copper(II) nitride (anhydrous, 99%, Acros Organics) and 0.8 M PVP under stirring. Then the mixture was kept in constant 45Â°C without any inert gas protection. After 3 h there was no further color change and red Cu nanoparticles were collected via centrifuge (8000 rpm for 30 min) of the colloid.
