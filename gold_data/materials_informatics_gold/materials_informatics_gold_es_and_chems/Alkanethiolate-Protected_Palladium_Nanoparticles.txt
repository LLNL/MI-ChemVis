In a typical reaction, 0.17 g (1 mmol) of PdCl2 was dissolved in 50 mL of ~0.5 M HCl under vigorous stirring. A total of 80 mL of toluene with 1.1 g of TOABr was then added into this solution, where the bright orange/red Pd(II) was transferred from the aqueous phase to the toluene phase. The aqueous phase was then removed, and a calculated amount of C6SH was injected into the toluene solution (depending on the desired C6SH:Pd ratio). The solution was stirred for about 20 min, and then 0.39 g of NaBH4 in 20 mL of H2O was added quickly into the solution, where, after a few seconds delay, the solution color changed rapidly from orange/red to dark green/black, indicating the formation of palladium particles, akin to the case of gold nanoparticles where the color changed from bright red to dark brown/black.
