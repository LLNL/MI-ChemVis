In a typical procedure, solutions of PVP (0.30 M, 5 ml, Mw≈40 000, Fluka) in anhydrous ethylene glycol (EG), CuSO4 (0.10 M, 3 ml) in EG and ascorbic acid (0.25 M, 3 ml) were prepared. The PVP solution was stirred with a magnetic bar and heated to 140 °C in a three-necked round bottom flask. Then the room temperature solutions of CuSO4 and ascorbic acid were simultaneously injected, drop-wise, into the hot PVP solution at a rate of approximately 0.25 ml min−1 by a syringe. Heating and stirring were maintained for a further hour and the solution finally turned reddish brown, it was then cooled to 80 °C and aged for approximately one hour in order to promote the growth of nanoparticles. It was necessary to add a further small amount of the ascorbic acid solution into the reaction mixture during this process to prevent the Cu nanocubes being oxidized. When the reaction finished, the reaction system was cooled to room temperature, then diluted with ethanol and centrifuged (2000 rpm, 15 min).
