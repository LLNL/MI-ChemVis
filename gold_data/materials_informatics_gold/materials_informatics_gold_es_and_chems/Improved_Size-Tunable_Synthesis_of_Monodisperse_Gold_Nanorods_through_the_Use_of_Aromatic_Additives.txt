A 5 mL amount of 0.5 mM HAuCl4 was mixed with 5 mL of 0.2 M CTAB solution. A 0.6 mL portion of fresh 0.01 M NaBH4 was diluted to 1 mL with water and was then injected into the Au(III)–CTAB solution under vigorous stirring (1200 rpm). The solution color changed from yellow to brownish-yellow, and the stirring was stopped after 2 min. The seed solution was aged at room temperature for 30 min before use. To prepare the growth solution, 9.0 g of CTAB together with defined amounts of additives (Table S1) were dissolved in 250 mL of warm water (50–70 °C, depending on the additive) in a 500 mL Erlenmeyer flask. The solution was allowed to cool to 30 °C, when a 4 mM AgNO3 solution, as detailed in Table S1, was added. The mixture was kept undisturbed at 30 °C for 15 min, after which 250 mL of 1 mM HAuCl4 solution and, if necessary, a small amount of HCl (37 wt % in water, 12.1 M) was added. After 15 min of slow stirring (400 rpm), 0.064 M ascorbic acid (Table S1) was added, and the solution was vigorously stirred for 30 s until it became colorless. The growth solution had a CTAB concentration of about 0.05 M and was used right after preparation. Finally, 0.8 mL of seed solution was injected into the growth solution. The resultant mixture was stirred for 30 s and left undisturbed at 30 °C for 12 h for NR growth.
