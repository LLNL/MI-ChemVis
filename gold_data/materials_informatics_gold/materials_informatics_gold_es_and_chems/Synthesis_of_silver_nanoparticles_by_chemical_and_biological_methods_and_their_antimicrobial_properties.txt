Sterile distilled water was used throughout the experiments. All ingredients of reacting materials were prepared in double distilled water. In typical experiment, 50 ml of 1 × 10−3 M AgNO3 was heated to boiling. To this solution, 5 ml of 1% trisodium citrate was included drop by drop. Solution was mixed vigorously during this process and heated until the colour change was noticeable (pale brown). Finally, it was removed from the heating element and stirred until cooled to room temperature. The final pH was adjusted to 6.0 and the flasks were incubated in the orbital shaker at 200 rpm at 32 °C. After five days of incubation, the mycelium was separated by filtration and supernatant was challenged with equal amount of silver nitrate solution of 1 mM (prepared in deionised water) and incubated in shaker at 200 rpm in dark condition at 32 °C (Figure 1). Simultaneously, a positive control of silver nitrate solution and deionised water, and a negative control containing only silver nitrate solution were maintained under same conditions. The reduction of pure silver ions synthesised by chemical and biological means was monitored by measuring the UV–Vis spectrum of the reaction mixture. One day old bacterial culture was taken (1 × 105 CFU/ml) and was used to prepare the bacterial lawns. The wells were injected with 60 μl of biologically synthesised silver nanoparticle solution, 60 μl of chemically synthesised silver nanoparticle solution, 60 μl of 1 mM AgNO3 as a negative control along with 60 μl of 30 μg/ml of streptomycin as a positive control. The plates were further incubated at 37 °C for 24 h and were then examined for the presence of zones of inhibition. In the case of chemical synthesis methods, a stabiliser (surfactant) is added to the first solution to prevent the agglomeration of silver nanoparticles, whereas in biological synthesis there is no need to add a stabilising agent.
