In a typical procedure, silver nitrate (0.02 M, 5 mL) and sodium chloride (0.02 M, 5 mL) were added to distilled water (30 mL) under stirring to form silver chloride colloidal solution. Then glucose (0.04 g, 0.2 mmol) was dissolved in the above colloidal solution; this was then transferred into a stainless steel autoclave with a Teflon liner of 50 mL capacity, and heated in an oven at 180 °C for 18 h. After the autoclave was air-cooled to room temperature unaided, the resulting silver-gray fluffy precipitate was filtered and washed with distilled water and absolute ethanol, then dried under vacuum at 60 °C for 2 h.
