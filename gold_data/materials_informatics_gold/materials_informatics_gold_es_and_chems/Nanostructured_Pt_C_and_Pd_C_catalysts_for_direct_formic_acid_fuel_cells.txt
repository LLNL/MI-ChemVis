The catalyst loadings at the anode and cathode were 8 and 4 mg cm−2 respectively and the effective electrode area was 6 cm2. The fuel was 3 M HCOOH delivered at 2 ml min−1 by a micropump and the oxygen flow was regulated by a flowmeter at 500 cm3 min−1. In another approach, first used by Yu and co-workers [16] and generally known as the polyol process, an ethylene glycol solution of the metal salt was refluxed at 393–443 K to generate in situ reducing species from ethylene glycol for the reduction of the metallic species. In a 100-ml beaker, 1.0 ml of an aqueous solution of 0.05 M H2PtCl6·6H2O (Aldrich, A.C.S. Reagent) or 0.05 M PdCl2 was mixed with 25 ml of ethylene glycol (Mallinckrodt, AR). Next, 0.4 M KOH was added drop wise to give a total volume of 0.75 (or 0.25 ml) and then 0.040 g of Vulcan XC-72 carbon with a specific BET surface-area of 250 m2 g−1 and an average article size of 40 nm was added to the mixture and sonicated. The beaker and its contents were heated in a house-hold microwave oven (National NN-S327WF, 2450 MHz, 700 W) for 50 s. The resulting suspension was filtered and the residue was washed with acetone and dried at 373 K overnight in a vacuum oven.
