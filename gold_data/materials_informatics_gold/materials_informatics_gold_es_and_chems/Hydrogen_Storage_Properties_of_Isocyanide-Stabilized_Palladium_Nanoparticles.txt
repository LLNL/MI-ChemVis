n-Octyl isocyanide was prepared from n-octylamine and chloroform in a 50% NaOH aqueous solution in the presence of benzyltriethylammonium chloride as a phase-transfer catalyst. Under a nitrogen atmosphere, PdCl2-(CH3CN)2 (2.59 g, 10.0 mmol) and [N(n-C8H17)4]Br (surfactant:  21.9 g, 40.0 mmol) were dissolved in dehydrated tetrahydrofuran (THF) (300 mL) and stirred until an orange-yellow solution was formed. Superhydride (LiBEt3H, 30 mL, 30.0 mmol, 1.0 M THF solution) was subsequently added to the solution, and immediately the solution turned dark brown. The mixture was vigorously stirred for 30 min. Then n-octyl isocyanide (2.78 g, 20 mmol) was added into the obtained dispersion. The mixture was stirred for another 15 min, and the solvent was removed by evaporation until only a small volume remained.
