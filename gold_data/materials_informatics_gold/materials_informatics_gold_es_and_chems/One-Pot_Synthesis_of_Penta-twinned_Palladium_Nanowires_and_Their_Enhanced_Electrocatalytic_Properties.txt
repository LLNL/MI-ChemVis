In a standard synthesis, 105 mg of PVP, 100 mg of AA, 100 mg of NaI, and 5 μL of aqueous HCl (12 M) were dissolved in 8 mL of DEG hosted in a 24 mL vial and heated at 160 °C in an oil bath for 15 min under magnetic stirring. Subsequently, 3 mL of DEG containing 30 mg of Na2PdCl4 was added in one shot through a pipet. After the reaction had proceeded for 1 h, it was terminated by immersing the vial in an ice–water bath. In a typical procedure, 2.0 mL of the Pd nanowires (0.20 mg/mL), 100 mg of AA, 66.6 mg of PVP, 54 mg of KBr, and 13 mL of EG were mixed in a 50 mL three-neck flask and heated at 110 °C for 15 min under magnetic stirring. The reaction temperature was then quickly ramped to 200 °C within 30 min. Meanwhile, 1.2 mg of Na2PtCl6·6H2O was dissolved in 12 mL of EG and this solution was then injected into the flask using a syringe pump at a rate of 4 mL/h. After completion of the injection, the reaction mixture was kept at 200 °C for another 10 min. The reaction was quenched by immersing the flask in an ice bath. In a typical process, 0.5 mL of the aqueous suspension of Pd@Pt core–sheath nanowires (0.48 mg/mL), 25 mg of FeCl3, 0.15 mL of HCl (12 M), 50 mg of PVP, 300 mg of KBr, and 7 mL of DI water was mixed in a 20 mL vial. The vial was then immersed in an oil bath held at 95 °C under magnetic stirring.
