The initial Au seeds were prepared by adding an ice-cold aqueous solution of NaBH4 (0.6 mL, 10 mM) into an aqueous solution of HAuCl4 (10 mL, 0.25 mM) and CTAB (100 mM). Then, the mixture was left undisturbed at 27 °C for 3 h to ensure the complete decomposition of any NaBH4 that remained in the reaction mixture. In a standard synthesis of 10 nm Au nanospheres, an aqueous solution of HAuCl4 (2 mL, 0.5 mM), an aqueous solution of CTAC (2 mL, 200 mM), and an aqueous solution of AA (1.5 mL, 100 mM) were mixed in a glass vial (20 mL), followed by the addition of the initial seeds (100 μL). The reaction was allowed to proceed at 27 °C for 10 min. For the synthesis of 25 nm Au nanospheres, an aqueous solution of HAuCl4 (2 mL, 0.25 mM), an aqueous solution of CTAC (2 mL, 200 mM), and an aqueous solution of AA (1.5 mL, 50 mM) were mixed in a vial (20 mL), followed by the addition of the as-prepared suspension of 10 nm Au nanospheres (100 μL, before washing). The reaction was allowed to proceed at 27 °C for 10 min.
