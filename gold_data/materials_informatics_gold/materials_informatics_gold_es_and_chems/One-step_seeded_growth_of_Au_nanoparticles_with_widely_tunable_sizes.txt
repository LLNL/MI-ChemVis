In a typical synthesis, Au seeds with an average diameter of ~3 nm (TEM, ESI†) were prepared by a direct reduction method using sodium borohydride as the reducing agent and trisodium citrate dihydrate (TSC) as the capping agent. More specifically, 1 mL of HAuCl4 (5 mM) and 1 mL of TSC (5 mM) were mixed with 18 mL of H2O in a flask. Under vigorous stirring, 0.6 mL of freshly made NaBH4 solution (0.1 M) was quickly injected into the solution, leading to an immediate color change to yellowish red. After stirring for 4 h, the solution was collected as the seed solution for subsequent seeded growth. Again under vigorous stirring, a predetermined amount of the seed solution (1–1600 μL) was then quickly injected into a freshly prepared growth solution of Au containing 500 μL of PVP (5 wt%), 250 μL of L-ascorbic acid (0.1 M), 200 μL of KI (0.2 M), 60 μL of HAuCl4 (0.25 M), and 2 mL of H2O.
