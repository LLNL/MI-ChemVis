In a typical synthesis, a solution of 0.6 mmol PVP was mixed with 10 mL of EG in a three-neck flask and heated at 150 °C for 1 h under argon flow. Ten minutes after the injection of 2 mL aqueous CTAB solution (0.09 M) into the flask, 1 mL of aqueous H2PdCl4 (0.125 M) solution was added in the solution with vigorous stirring. The solution was then kept at 150 °C for 30 min and cooled to room temperature.
