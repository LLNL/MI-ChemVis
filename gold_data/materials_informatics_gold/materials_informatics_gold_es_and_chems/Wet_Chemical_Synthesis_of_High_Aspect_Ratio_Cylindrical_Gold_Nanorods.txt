A 20 mL aqueous solution containing 2.5 × 10-4 M HAuCl4 and 2.5 × 10-4 M tri-sodium citrate was prepared in a conical flask. Next, 0.6 mL of ice cold 0.1 M NaBH4 solution was added to the solution all at once while stirring. The particles in this solution were used as seeds within 2−5 h after preparation. In a clean test tube, 10 mL of growth solution, containing 2.5 × 10-4 M HAuCl4 and 0.1 M cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), was mixed with 0.05 mL of 0.1 M freshly prepared ascorbic acid solution. Next, 0.025 mL of the 3.5 nm seed solution was added. No further stirring or agitation was done. Within 5−10 min, the solution color changed to reddish brown. The solution was stable for more than one month. A three-step seeding method was used for this nanorod preparation. Three test tubes (labeled A, B, and C), each containing 9 mL growth solution, consisting of 2.5 × 10-4 M HAuCl4 and 0.1 M CTAB, were mixed with 0.05 mL of 0.1 M ascorbic acid. Next, 1.0 mL of the 3.5 nm seed solution was mixed with sample A. After 4−5 h, 1.0 mL was drawn from solution A and added to solution B, followed by thorough mixing. The color of solution B turned red within 4−5 min. After 4−5 h, 1 mL of B was mixed with C. Solution C turned red in color within 10 min. This procedure was similar to the method for preparing 13 aspect ratio rods. For 13 aspect ratio rods, the seed or solutions A and B were added to the growth solution after the growth occurring in the previous reaction was complete. But to make 18 aspect ratio rods, particles from A and B were transferred to the growth solution while the particles in these solution were still growing. Typically, solution A was transferred to B after 15 s of adding 3.5 nm seed to A, and solution B was transferred to C after 30 s of adding solution A to B.
