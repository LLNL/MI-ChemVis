In a typical synthesis, 6 mL ethylene glycol (EG, J.T. Baker, 9300-03) was heated under stirring with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar for 1 hour in a 24-mL glass vial. While the EG was heated, EG solutions containing AgNO3 (48 mg/mL, Aldrich, 209139) and poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP, 20 mg/mL, MW ~55,000, Aldrich, 856568) were prepared. A 3 mM solution of Na2S (Aldrich, 208043) or NaHS (Aldrich, 161527) in EG was also prepared 45 minutes prior to injection. Shortly after injecting 80 μL of the sulfide solution, 1.5 mL and 0.5 mL of the PVP and AgNO3 solutions were sequentially injected (all with a micro-pipettor). As silver nitrate was added, the clear and colorless solution immediately turned purple-black, followed instantly by a transparent bright yellow color. In a typical synthesis, a fixed amount (100 μL) of the as-synthesized silver nanocubes was dispersed in 5 mL water containing 1 mg/mL PVP in a 50 mL flask under magnetic stirring and then heated to boil for 10 minutes. A specific amount (3 mL) of 0.2 mM HAuCl4 aqueous solution was added to the flask through a syringe pump at a rate of 45 mL/h under magnetic stirring. The solution was heated for another 10 minutes until the color of the system was stable.
