The seed solution was prepared in a 20 mL flask in which two aqueous solutions of HAuCl4Â·3 H2O (5.0 mL; 0.5 mmol/L) and CTAB (2.5 mL; 0.20 mol/L) were added. In the sequence, an ice-cold aqueous solution of NaBH4 (0.6 mL; 0.01 mol/L) was added at one time. The resulting solution was kept under gentle magnetic stirring for 2 min. The resulting solution was used for a period of 2 h after the preparation.
