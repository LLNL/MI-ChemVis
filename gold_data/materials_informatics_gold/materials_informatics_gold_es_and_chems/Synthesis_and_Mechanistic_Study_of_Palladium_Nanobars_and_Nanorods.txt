In a typical synthesis, 5 mL of EG was hosted in a 25-mL, three-neck flask (equipped with a reflux condenser and a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar) and heated in air under magnetic stirring at 100 °C. Meanwhile, 0.0486 g of Na2PdCl4 and 0.600 g of KBr were dissolved in 3 mL of water, and 0.0916 g of PVP was dissolved in 3 mL of EG at room temperature. These two solutions (with the molar ratio of PdCl42- to Br- and the repeating unit of PVP being 1:30:15) were then injected simultaneously into the flask using a two-channel syringe pump (KDS-200, Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL) at a rate of 45 mL per hour. The reaction mixture was heated at 100 °C in air for 1 h before the product was collected by centrifugation and washed with acetone once and with ethanol three times to remove most of the EG and excess PVP.
