Briefly, Al foils were first cleaned in acetone, annealed in N2 at 500 °C for 4 h, and then electropolished at 48 V in a perchloric acid:ethanol (1:5, v/v, ratio) mixture. Anodization was performed potentiostatically in 0.3 M oxalic acid at 40 V or in 0.3 M sulphuric acid at 25 V. The electrolyte temperature was kept constant at 15 °C and the anodization time was 8 h in all cases. After the first anodization, the oxide film with a low pore ordering was removed in 5 wt.% phosphoric acid:1.8 wt.% chromic acid at 70 °C. Pores were rounded and further widened by dipping the membranes in 5 wt.% phosphoric acid for a few min. The template was then sealed and its non-coated part was exposed to the electrolyte compartment of the electrodeposition cell. Finally, the water in the cell was removed and replaced immediately with the deposition electrolyte that consisted of 70 mM K2PdCl4 in 20 mM H2SO4. Pd electrodeposition was carried out at 0.3 VAg/AgCl in all cases. In some cases, the alumina template was removed by soaking the sample in a 0.1 M NaOH solution for 24 h, in order to obtain and study the characteristics of liberated Pd NWs. In the case of dp ≈ 35 nm, the current density at first decreases monotonically from 0.4 to 0.3 mA cm−2 in 10 min, then remains constant until tdep ≈ 40 min. The residue of etching was carefully removed by washing the sample with de-ionized water several times.
