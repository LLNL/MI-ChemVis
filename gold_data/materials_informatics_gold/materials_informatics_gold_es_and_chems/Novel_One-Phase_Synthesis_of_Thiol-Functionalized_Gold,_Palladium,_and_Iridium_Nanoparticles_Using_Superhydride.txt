A 235 mg (0.82 mmol) sample of octadecanethiol (C18H37SH, ODT) was added under vigorous stirring to a solution of 0.9 mmol of hydrogen tetrachloroaureate(III) trihydrate (H[Au(Cl4)]·3H2O) in 10 mL of freshly distilled, anhydrous THF. The reaction mixture was stirred for approximately 20 min at room temperature, before a 1.0 M solution of lithium triethylborohydride in THF was added dropwise. The mixture turned dark red-brown immediately. The addition of the reducing agent was continued at increasingly slower rate, until no more gas evolution could be observed. A 0.426 g (1.5 mmol) sample of ODT was added, under vigorous stirring, to a solution of 0.336 g (0.5 mmol) of palladium(II) acetate trimer ([Pd(C2H3O2)2]3) in 10 mL of freshly distilled THF. The solution immediately turned light brown and was stirred for an additional 30 min. “Superhydride” (8 mL) was added, and the reaction mixture was stirred for 2 h more, at which point it was dark brown. A 0.186 g (0.5 mmol) sample of dihydrogen hexachloroiridate(IV) H2IrCl6·H2O was added under vigorous stirring to a solution of 0.142 g (0.5 mmol) of ODT in 10 mL of freshly distilled THF under nitrogen. A 7 mL aliquot of “superhydride” was added dropwise to the solution, which turned light greenish brown and became more homogeneous.
