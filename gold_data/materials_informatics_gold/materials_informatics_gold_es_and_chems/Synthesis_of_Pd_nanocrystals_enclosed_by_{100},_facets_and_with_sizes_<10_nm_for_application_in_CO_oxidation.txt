In the case of 300 mg of KBr, the color change was observed at t = 2 min. With the addition of 600 mg KBr, the color of the solution remained unchanged for 5 min. When only 5 mg KBr was introduced into the solution, the color changed very quickly, and Pd nanocrystals with a size of ~4 nm were obtained. The color of the solution started to change at t = 30 s, indicating that the reduction in this case was much faster than the synthesis in which 300 mg KBr was introduced. In a typical synthesis of Pd cubes/bars with different sizes, 8.0 mL of an aqueous solution containing poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP MW ≈ 55 000, 105 mg, Aldrich), L-ascorbic acid (AA, 60 mg, Aldrich), and different amounts of KBr and KCl were placed in a 20 mL vial, and pre-heated in air under magnetic stirring at 80 °C for 10 min. Then, 3.0 mL of an aqueous solution containing Na2PdCl4 (57 mg, Aldrich) was added using a pipette. After the vial had been capped, the reaction was allowed to proceed at 80 °C for 3 h.
