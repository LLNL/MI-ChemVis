A typical procedure is as follows: the required volumes of freshly prepared aqueous solutions containing NaBH4 and TSC were mixed and heated to 60 °C for 30 minutes in the dark with vigorous stirring to ensure a homogenous solution. At the end of 30 minutes, the required volume of AgNO3 solution was added drop-wise to the mixture and subsequently, the temperature was further raised to 90 °C. As the temperature reached 90 °C, the pH of the solution was adjusted to 10.5 using 0.1 M NaOH while heating was continued for 20 minutes, until a change of colour was evident. The nanoparticle suspension was allowed to cool at room temperature.
