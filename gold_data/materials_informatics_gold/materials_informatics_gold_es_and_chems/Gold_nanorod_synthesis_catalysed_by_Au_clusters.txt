5 ml of 0.2 M CTAB solution was mixed with 2.5 ml of 5 × 10−4 M HAuCl4. While stirring the solution, 30 μl of ice-cold freshly prepared 0.1 M NaBH4 was added, which results in the formation of a solution with a brownish yellow colour. Vigorous stirring of the seed solution was continued for 2 minutes. The seeds were used after 10 min of preparation. 5 ml of 0.2 M CTAB solution was mixed with 5 ml of 5 × 10−4 M HAuCl4. While stirring the solution, 60 μl of ice-cold freshly prepared 0.1 M NaBH4 was added, which results in the formation of a solution with a brownish yellow colour. Vigorous stirring of the cluster solution was continued and used after 10 s, 30 s, 1 min and 5 min of preparation. 2.5 ml of 0.2 M CTAB solution were added to 100 μl of 4 × 10−3 M AgNO3 solution at 25 °C. To this solution, 2.5 ml of 10−3 M HAuCl4 were added and, after gentle mixing of the solution, 35 μl of 0.0788 M ascorbic acid (freshly prepared) were added. For comparison experiments, 6 μl of the seed solution were added. The colour of the solution gradually changed within 10–20 min. 5 ml of the gold cluster solution were added to 2.5 ml of deionized water at 25 °C. To this solution, 2.5 ml of 10−3 M HAuCl4 were added and, after gentle mixing of the solution, 35 μl of 0.0788 M ascorbic acid (freshly prepared) were added. For comparison experiments, 6 μl of the seed solution were added. The colour of the solution gradually changed within 10–20 min.
