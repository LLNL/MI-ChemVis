The preparation procedure of the Ag nanowires was described as follows: Firstly, 10 ml ethylene glycol (EG) was refluxed in three-necked round-bottom flask at 160 °C for 2 h, then 6 ml EG solution of 0.1 M silver nitrate and 6 ml EG solution of 0.6 M PVP were simultaneously injected dropwise. After injection, the solution turned turbid with a grey color in about 15 min, indicating the appearance of Ag nanowires, and the reaction continued at 160 °C for 60 min.
