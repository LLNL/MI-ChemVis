Cu(NO3)2 (Sigma-Aldrich, 0.1 M, 1 mL), NaOH (Acros Organics, 15 M, 20 mL) and EDA (Sigma-Aldrich, 150 μL) were mixed in a 50 mL round bottom flask with a glass stopper and heated to 50 °C at a stirring rate of 700 rpm. N2H4 (Sigma-Aldrich, 35 wt%, 25 μL) was quickly injected into the above solution after stirring for 5 min. Upon addition of N2H4, the mixture initially turned white and cloudy, and changed to a clear and colorless solution within the first 2 min. The solution remained clear till t = ~60 min when a dark red color slowly appeared throughout the entire solution. An aqueous solution (~15 mL) containing 3% PVP (polyvinylpyrrolidone, Sigma-Aldrich, MW = 10 K) and 1% DEHA (diethylhydroxylamine, Acros Organics) was added to the growth solution to collect the nanowires. The mixture was then transferred to a separation funnel and vigorously shaken until a white clump of PVP and nanowires floated to the surface. The bottom solution was drained and fresh PVP/DEHA solution was added to re-disperse the nanowires. Seed solution was prepared by adding N2H4 (35%, 25 μL) into a preheated mixture (50 °C, stirred at 700 rpm) of Cu(NO3)2 (0.1 M, 1 mL), NaOH (15 M, 20 mL). After stirring for 2 min, 5 mL, 2 mL, or 1 mL of seed solution was transferred to a preheated growth solution (50 °C, stirred at 700 rpm) containing Cu(NO3)2 (0.1 M, 1 mL), NaOH (15 M, 20 mL) and EDA (150 μL, 2.25 mmol), to produce nanowires with an aspect ratio of 380, 720, and 1130, respectively. N2H4 (35 wt%, 25 μL) was then added, the stirring was stopped after 2 min, and the mixture slowly changed from orange to deep red over the next 20 min. A mixture of Cu(NO3)2 (0.1 M, 1 mL), NaOH (15 M, 20 mL) and a certain amount of EDA was preheated with stirring at 700 rpm for 5 min at 50 °C. After N2H4 (35%, 25 μL) was added, the solution turned orange and Cu2O octahedra formed. The Cu2O particles were collected using the PVP/DEHA solution and purified with 1% DEHA solution for further characterization with SEM and XRD. The collected particles were then dissolved in concentrated nitric acid (1 mL) and diluted to a set volume.
