Pd nanocubes were synthesized as follow: First, a 10 mM Na2PdCl4 aqueous solution was prepared by completely dissolving 44.5 mg of PdCl2 in 5 mL of 100 mM HCl and 19 mL of deionized water, followed by the addition of 1 mL of 500 mM NaOH. Typically, the Na2PdCl4 and CTAB solutions were added to the AA solution in the following two different ways. In the first method (method A), 1 mL of 10 mM Na2PdCl4 was mixed with 1 mL of 10 mM CTAB, and the mixture was then dripped into a flask containing 4 mL of 25 mM AA over a period of 5 min. The whole solution was kept under stirring for an hour. In the second method (method B), 1 mL of 10 mM Na2PdCl4 and 1 mL of 10 mM CTAB were injected simultaneously into a flask containing 4 mL of 25 mM AA with a homemade two-channel syringe pump at a rate of 12 mL/h. The whole solution was then kept under stirring for another 30 min. All reactions were performed at room temperature.
