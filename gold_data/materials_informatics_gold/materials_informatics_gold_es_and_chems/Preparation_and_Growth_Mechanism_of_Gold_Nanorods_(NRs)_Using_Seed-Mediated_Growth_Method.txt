To grow longer NRs with aspect ratios ranging from 4.6 to 10, a binary surfactant mixture composed of benzyldimethylhexadecylammoniumchloride (BDAC) and CTAB was used. NRs are grown in this mixture either by aging or by addition of a growth solution suitable to shorter NRs. CTAB solution (5 mL, 0.20 M) was mixed with 5.0 mL of 0.00050 M HAuCl4. To the stirred solution, 0.60 mL of ice-cold 0.010 M NaBH4 was added, which resulted in the formation of a brownish yellow solution. Vigorous stirring of the seed solution was continued for 2 min. After the solution was stirred, it was kept at 25 °C. CTAB (5 mL, 0.20 M) was added to (0.050, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25 mL) of 0.0040 M AgNO3 solution at 25 °C. To this solution, 5.0 mL of 0.0010 M HAuCl4 was added, and after gentle mixing of the solution 70 μL of 0.0788 M ascorbic acid was added. The final step was the addition of 12 μL of the seed solution to the growth solution at 27−30 °C. The color of the solution gradually changed within 10−20 min. The temperature of the growth medium was kept constant at 27−30 °C in all the experiments. In both cases a binary surfactant mixture of benzyldimethylhexadecylammoniumchloride (BDAC) and CTAB was used. In the first approach the surfactant mixture was prepared by adding 5 mL of 0.15 M BDAC to 0.010, 0.030, 0.050, 0.080, 0.10, 0.12, and 0.20 g of CTAB for making surfactant mixtures with ratios of 27 to 1.3. After dissolving the mixtures by sonication (20 min at 40 °C), each solution was added to 200 μL of 0.0040 M AgNO3. In these solutions the silver content was kept constant while the fraction of the cosurfactant (CTAB) was changed. To this solution, 5.0 mL of 0.0010 M HAuCl4 was added, and after gentle mixing of the solution 70 μL of 0.0778 M ascorbic acid was added. By aging the NR solution for 7 days, the aspect ratio increases to 9−10. The growth process was initiated after adding 12 μL of seed solution. The growth solution (called B) was prepared by adding 5.0 mL of a mixture of 0.15 M BDAC and 0.10 g of CTAB to 200 μL of 0.0040 M AgNO3. This solution was then added to 5.0 mL of 0.00050 M HAuCl4 solution. To this solution, 36 μL of 0.0778 M ascorbic acid was added, which resulted in a colorless solution. The growth solution (B) was added to solution A at a rate of 1.0 mL per 20 min. The growth solution (B) was added to solution A at a rate of 1.0 mL per 20 min. By introducing 12 μL of the 5-min-aged seed solution to a growth solution, the NRs start to grow.
