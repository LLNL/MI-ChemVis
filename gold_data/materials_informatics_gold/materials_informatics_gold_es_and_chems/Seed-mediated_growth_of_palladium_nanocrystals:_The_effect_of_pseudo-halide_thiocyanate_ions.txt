A 10 mM H2PdCl4 solution was prepared by dissolving 0.1773 g PdCl2 in 10 mL of 0.2 M HCl solution and further diluting to 100 mL with doubly distilled water. Synthesis of 22 nm Pd nanocubes as seeds. The method of producing Pd seeds is similar to our previous reports.20 Briefly, 0.5 mL aliquot of 10 mM H2PdCl4 solution was added to 9420 µL of 12.5 mM CTAB solution heated at 95 °C under stirring. After 5 minutes, 80 µL of freshly prepared 100 mM ascorbic acid solution was added, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 20 min. The nanocube solution was stored at 30 °C for future use as seeds. Seed-mediated growth of polyhedral palladium nanocrystals. In a typical synthesis, 5 µL of 1 mM KSCN solution was added to 5 mL of 100 mM CTAB solution kept at a given temperature. 250 µL of 10 mM H2PdCl4 solution and 80 µL as-synthesized seed palladium nanocube solution were then added. Finally, 50 µL of freshly prepared 100 mM ascorbic acid solution was added and the solution was mixed thoroughly. The resulting solution was placed in a water bath at 40 °C, 60 °C and 80 °C, respectively.
