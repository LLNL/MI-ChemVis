Solutions were prepared with double distilled water. 0.0356 g of PdCl2 was accurately weighed and dissolved in 100 ml of HCl (0.000413 M) to form an H2PdCl4 aqueous solution. An aliquot of 5 ml of the aqueous H2PdCl4 solution was mixed with 5 ml of a 0.2 % aqueous solution of XG in a boiling tube. This reaction is carried out in an autoclave at a pressure of 15 psi and at 120 °C temperature by 10 min time. To a 3-ml cuvette containing freshly prepared sodium borohydrate (1 ml, 15 mM) solution, 2 ml of 4-NP (0.2 mM) solution was added. After adding PdNPs stabilized in XG (10 µl) solution, cuvette was shaken vigorously for mixing and kept in UV–Vis spectrophotometer to examine the reaction. The reaction was carried out in an autoclave at a pressure of 15 psi and at 120 °C temperature. The yellow colour reaction mixture was converted to the characteristic black colour after the autoclaving.
