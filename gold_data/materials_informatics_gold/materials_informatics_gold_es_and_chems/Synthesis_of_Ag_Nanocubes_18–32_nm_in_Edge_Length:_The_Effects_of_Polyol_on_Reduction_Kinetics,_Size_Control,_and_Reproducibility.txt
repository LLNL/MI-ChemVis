The standard synthesis of Ag nanocrystals was carried out in a 100 mL flask with round-bottom (ACE Glass). In a standard synthesis, 5 mL of DEG was added into a flask and heated under magnetic stirring in an oil bath set to 150 °C for 30 min. Other reagents were separately dissolved in DEG and sequentially introduced into the flask using a pipet. Specifically, 0.06 mL of NaSH solution (3 mM) was added first. After 4 min, 0.5 mL of HCl (3 mM) was added, followed by 1.25 mL of PVP (20 mg/mL). After another 2 min, 0.4 mL of CF3COOAg solution (282 mM) was introduced. During the entire process, the flask was capped with glass stoppers except for the addition of reagents. The synthesis was quenched by placing the flask in an ice–water bath and the products were collected by centrifugation, followed by washing with acetone and then DI water to remove the remaining precursor, DEG, and excess PVP.
